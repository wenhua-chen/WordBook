1
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,208
Amanda?

2
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:29,792
What're you doing?

3
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,583
Well, I couldn't sleep.

4
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,791
And it has been such
a hellish year for us as you know,

5
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,124
and I just seem to be working
every day without even realizing it.

6
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,916
And you are just constantly
anxious about your job

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,916
because of all the budget cuts.
So, I went online this morning

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,125
and I rented us a beautiful house
out by the beach.

9
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,833
And it was such a steal
even though it's barely the off-season.

10
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:53,708
Wait, are... are you packing?

11
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,750
Yeah. I thought I'd get a jump on it.

12
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,458
Wait. I don't understand.

13
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,000
When did you rent a house for?

14
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:03,249
Today.

15
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,874
I figured if I made the reservation
and packed our bags,

16
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,875
it would eliminate
most of the reasons to say no.

17
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:12,249
Oh, and I printed out the little thingy
there for you from the website.

18
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,583
It's right by your coffee,
made it just the way you like it.

19
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,916
I didn't want to wake the kids
so I haven't packed for them yet.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,624
But honestly, I think they're going to be
super psyched about this.

21
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:26,041
Well, you know me,
I'm always down for a little vacay.

22
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,500
Especially with the kids.
We haven't done that in a while.

23
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:35,042
But help me out here, babe. I mean...
...why today?

24
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:42,125
Well, when I couldn't fall back asleep
this morning, I came over here.

25
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,624
To watch the sunrise.

26
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:48,624
And I saw all these people
starting their day

27
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,792
with such tenacity. Such verve.

28
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,292
All in an effort to...

29
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,292
...make something of themselves.

30
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,250
Make something of our world.

31
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,708
I felt so lucky to be a part of that.

32
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,250
But then, I remembered...

33
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,333
...what the world is actually like.

34
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:14,000
And I came to a more accurate realization.

35
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,917
I fucking hate people.

00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,333
The undertow's horrible...

156
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,625
Look at that boat.

157
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,292
It's so big.

158
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,208
Hey, Mom, Taylor just dropped a pin.

159
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,417
Can you, uh, can you look at that
and see how far her house is?

160
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,416
Just look. Y-You said
maybe we could drive over there.

161
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,125
- Right? So, maybe?
- Mm-hmm.

162
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,791
All right, that's Sag Harbor.
That's at least an hour away, honey.

163
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:34,875
It's getting closer.

164
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,958
- What is?
- The ship.

165
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:41,292
Oh, yeah. She's a beaut.
Looks like an oil tanker.

166
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:43,666
Must be a port around here.

167
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,083
I read this piece in <i>The Atlantic</i>

168
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:48,583
that says New York has one of the largest
natural harbors on the planet.

169
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,583
You okay, Rose?

170
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,167
I think that ship is heading towards us.

171
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,042
What was that, sweetie?

172
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,792
- Clay?
- Hmm?

173
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,208
- Clay.
- Yeah.

174
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,625
Wow. It's getting close, huh?

175
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:42,500
You think that's a problem?

176
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,750
Nah, come on.
It's gonna stop. It's got to.

177
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,333
Right?

178
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,458
Wake up. Archie, come on, bud.
Help us pack up.

179
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,458
Leaving already? Why?

180
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,208
Holy fuck.

181
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:02,625
Jesus, Archie, let's go.

182
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,625
Let's go! Go, go, go!

183
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,666
Come on, keep it moving.
Keep it moving, guys.

184
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,749
Excuse me, officer.
Do you know what happened?

185
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,624
There's been a handful of these groundings up the coast,

186
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,667
something to do with the nav system.
Sorry guys, I need you to keep it moving.

187
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,042
Keep it moving, guys.

188
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:22,916
There's a Starbucks.

189
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,083
Oh.

190
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,749
I wanted to read up on what happened
at the beach but the Wi-Fi isn't working.

191
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,499
You think the router needs a reset?

192
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,041
Well, sorry, I can't help you there.
You are the tech wiz, not I.

193
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,374
You know, the TV's out too.

194
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,833
I tried to check the game
but there's no signal.

195
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,624
You still gonna be down
for burgers tonight?

196
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,375
Yeah, I could be down for that.

197
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:51,083
Meanwhile, the kids seem
to have completely gotten over it

198
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,124
like it was something they saw on a show.

199
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,000
They're on to the next episode.

200
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:01,917
Clay.

201
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,167
Come here, look.

202
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,083
Oh, wow.

203
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,250
That's a good omen. Seeing deer.

204
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,833
Hmm.

205
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:19,375
At least according to
Mesoamerican mythology.

206
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,667
You gonna help? Hmm?

207
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,041
Uh, wha-- Yes. Yes, I'm here to help.

208
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,500
Uh-oh.

209
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,041
- Don't, don't do it that way.
- No, no, no, no, no. Well...

210
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,708
- Don't, don't go in the middle.
- No, I'm gonna go in the middle.

211
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:29,792
Because it'll make it harder for you.
And isn't that the point of my life?

212
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,666
You getting some more?
Would you top me up?

213
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,916
Uh-huh.

214
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,458
Sure, but I think I'm donezo.
I need a glass of water,

215
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:47,000
or I'm going to have
a motherfucker of a hangover tomorrow.

216
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:52,000
Hey, you remember that student of mine
who was published last year? Maria Miller?

217
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:56,792
Well, she wants me to write
the foreword to her second book.

218
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,749
I mean, you know, she says
I'm some kind of huge inspiration.

219
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,999
I never know if I'm even
getting through to these kids

220
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,374
and then something like this happens...

221
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,750
Shh!

222
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,208
- Did you hear that?
- Mm-mm.

223
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:13,166
Her second book is like an exploration

224
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,291
of how media serves as
both an escape and a reflection.

225
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,749
Which is a contradiction

226
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,916
that she manages to reconcile.

227
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,083
Someone's here.

228
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,708
Get a bat.

229
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,125
- A bat?
- Yeah.

230
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,124
Why would I have a bat?

231
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,083
I'm sorry. Hello?

232
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:42,792
I'm sure it's nothing.
Let me take care of it.

233
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,583
Actually, you know what?
Get your cell phone.

234
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,000
Just, you know, just in case.

235
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,083
I'm so sorry to bother you.

236
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,125
Hello. Hi.

237
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,042
- I'm so sorry to bother you.
- In case you didn't know.

238
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,291
Well, can I help you?

239
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,792
I know it's late.
A knock at the door, way out here.

240
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,541
Couldn't decide if we should knock
at the front door or the side door,

241
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,249
and this went on for some time.

242
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,833
I thought we should try the side door
because it has glass

243
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:19,500
and you'd have seen us
and known we're just...

244
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,000
You must be Amanda.

245
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:25,000
A-Amanda Sandford, right?

246
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,958
You, you two know each other?

247
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,291
No, we have not had the pleasure
of meeting face-to-face.

248
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,333
I'm- I'm G.H. G.H. Scott.

249
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,249
George. He's George.
That's how it reads in his email.

250
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,375
Oh. Forgive me. I forgot.

251
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,333
See, this is why I much preferred life
before the internet,

252
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,124
because we would have spoken on the phone,
you would have recognized my voice

253
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,708
and known that this is our house.

254
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,708
I'm sorry?

255
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:58,375
This is our house. I'm the George
you emailed back and forth with.

256
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,667
No, I-I remember the name, I just...

257
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,833
This is... this is <i>your</i> house?

258
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,333
Mm.

259
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,541
I'm sorry. You think we could come inside?

260
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,166
Oh, yeah. Hey, sure.
Y-Yeah, come, come on in.

261
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,250
Yeah. Got cold out all of a sudden.

262
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,749
I understand how strange
this must be for you.

263
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,333
Us, turning up like this unannounced.

264
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:31,500
We would have called, you see,
but, uh... the phones are out.

265
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,833
Yeah, my phone doesn't
seem to have service.

266
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,500
It's almost as if we're telling the truth.

267
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,499
Uh...

268
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,708
Hey. I'm Clay.

269
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:43,916
- Ruth.
- Hi.

270
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,458
- And I'm G.H., again.
- G.H.

271
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:46,708
- Clay, nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

272
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:50,333
Why don't we... sit down?

273
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,791
And you know, talk.

274
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,374
The children are sleeping.

275
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,166
I wouldn't worry too much about them.

276
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,541
I mean, Archie'd sleep
through the atom bomb.

277
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,208
You know?
Let's go in the kitchen.

278
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:08,708
Tonight we were at the symphony
in the Bronx. Have you been?

279
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,291
Uh... No.

280
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,249
Their productions
are in a class of their own.

281
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,541
He's on the board of the Philharmonic.

282
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,874
He likes to encourage everyone he knows
to take an interest in classical music.

283
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,874
So in other words,
I am one lucky daughter.

284
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,333
Do you mind if I get a glass of water?

285
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,167
Uh, no, no. Uh, help yourself.

286
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,541
Anyway, we were driving
back to the city, home.

287
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,666
And then something happened.

288
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,249
A blackout.

289
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,124
- A blackout?
- Mm.

290
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,583
The lights seem,
seem to be working pretty good.

291
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:43,542
Um...

292
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,667
Exactly, right, so, um... we thought...

293
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:53,041
Well, with everything that's probably
going on in the city right now,

294
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,083
we didn't--

295
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:57,542
We live on the 14th floor and he can't
climb 14 flights because of his knee.

296
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,666
Plus the traffic lights went out.

297
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,208
We would have been sitting in a six hour
parking lot if we'd headed home.

298
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:07,208
So there was a blackout and you decided
to drive all the way out here?

299
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:10,792
These roads, they're familiar.
I barely even thought about it.

300
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,874
So when we saw the lights go,
I looked at Ruth--

301
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,167
And said that he would feel better
if we stayed here.

302
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:20,292
You know, in his house.

303
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:25,541
Wait. Y-You, you want to stay here?
But... we're staying here.

304
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,917
Well, under the circumstances,
we, we thought you might understand.

305
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:34,833
- Of course. Yeah. It's just--
- Uh...

306
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:39,083
I think what he means is,
of course we understand--

307
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,874
I know it's a surprise,
but we thought maybe if you let us stay--

308
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:42,958
Because, again...

309
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,875
You know, it is like...

310
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,667
our house.

311
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:54,208
What she's trying to say is
we wanted to be somewhere safe.

312
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,374
Well, you know, we're, we're on vacation.

313
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:00,375
Clay, Amanda, we could absolutely
refund you your money.

314
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,833
You want us to leave?

315
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,833
I-It's the middle of the night.
My, my children are sleeping upstairs.

316
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,791
You come in here
and talk about refunding our money.

317
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,874
I-I think I need to call the company.
I don't even think you can do this.

318
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,583
Um, there's got to be
a number on their web--

319
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,583
Th-That's really not necessary.

320
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,499
Why not?

321
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:18,541
Because we're not saying you should leave.

322
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:22,708
We could refund you,
say, 50% of what you paid.

323
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,083
You know, there's an in-law suite.
We could stay downstairs.

324
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:26,999
Downstairs?

325
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:27,916
Fifty percent?

326
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,833
I think we need to look at
the terms and conditions here. Uh...

327
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:33,249
A-All right, we need to find
the, the Wi-Fi router.

328
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,208
- Okay, I'll try tethering it to my cell.
- It needs to be reset.

329
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:37,166
All right, well, the phones
aren't working, Clay.

330
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,541
How's that supposed to make a difference?

331
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,791
I think the internet is down anyway, so--

332
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,416
Okay, look. I'm... I'm sorry.

333
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,958
I just, uh, I don't feel comfortable
staying in a house with...

334
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,416
...people I don't know.

335
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,667
Uh, it's a blackout.
I-It could be over in a couple of hours.

336
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:56,750
May I?

337
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:17,083
I should have listened to my wife
and had these labeled already.

338
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,958
Yeah...

339
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,792
Ah... Here we are.

340
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,166
Yeah... I can give you
a thousand dollars now for the night.

341
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,375
That should cover almost half
of what you're paying for the weekend.

342
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,166
It's a thousand dollars.

343
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,791
We'll be very grateful.

344
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,916
Then tomorrow, we'll know
a little more and...

345
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,041
- ...we'll figure this all out.
- Yeah.

346
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:07,124
Meanwhile this thing is not responding.

347
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:10,583
So anyway, I say one night, it's like--

348
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,708
I think we should discuss this privately.

349
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,374
You know, we're gonna go talk
in the other room, all right?

350
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,500
Hmm.

351
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:23,708
- Say, you mind if I made myself a drink?
- Oh, sure. Make yourself right at-- Um.

352
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:25,917
Yep.

353
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,958
Why did, why did you tell them
they could stay?

354
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:30,583
I mean, it's a blackout.

355
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,333
What, you, y-you think they're lying?

356
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:35,083
I mean, it's a young woman and her father,
they look innocent enough.

357
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:35,999
They're strangers.

358
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,541
They introduced themselves.

359
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:39,708
They knocked on the door
in the middle of the night.

360
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:41,374
Would you rather them burst in?

361
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,666
They scared the shit out of me.

362
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,583
Well, I think, you know,
that they were scared too.

363
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:48,041
Right? I mean,
they didn't know what else to do.

364
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:50,124
Well, here's an idea: go to a hotel.

365
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:53,458
This is their home as, you know,
the girl kept reminding us.

366
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:57,208
Well, we didn't ask for any proof.
I didn't hear their car. Did you?

367
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:59,458
No, but it's windy.
Maybe we just didn't hear it.

368
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:00,916
Or maybe they snuck up the road.

369
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,416
Or, maybe we should calm down a little?

370
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,624
I'm sorry. I just--

371
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:08,208
This really doesn't seem like their house.

372
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:10,125
The board of the Philharmonic?

373
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,666
I don't know.
It just all feels like a con to me.

374
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,916
They want to stay here? With us?

375
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,083
Forget it. I wouldn't be able to sleep
with strangers in the house.

376
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:23,208
Rose is right down the hall.
What if he sneaks in...

377
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:24,374
I don't want to think about it.

378
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,917
You don't think
he'd want to molest Archie, though.

379
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,499
What are you talking about?

380
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:33,124
I'm just saying I don't like
the way any of this sounds. Okay?

381
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:36,166
He came here because he doesn't want
to climb a flight of fucking stairs?

382
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,417
Give me a break.
All feels a little improvised.

383
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,292
God, what if it's a scam?

384
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:45,624
What if the blackout and whatever

385
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:47,333
that's just all part of the story?

386
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,749
I don't think they made that up.

387
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,416
I mean, that's probably why the phones
and the internet aren't working.

388
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,916
And besides, hey. He had the keys.

389
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,124
He opened up the liquor cabinet. Remember?

390
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:57,624
So what if he had the keys?

391
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:01,166
Maybe he's the handyman.
She's the housekeeper.

392
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,958
The housekeeper always knows
where the stash of money is.

393
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:06,749
And besides, he had his back to us.
Maybe he broke into it.

394
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,999
I don't see what he has to gain
by giving us a thousand bucks.

395
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:14,999
Why are you trying so hard to believe
everyone except your own wife?

396
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,874
Something is happening
and I don't trust them.

397
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:22,750
I think they are scared, nice people
who need a place to spend the night.

398
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,499
All right, I'm going to go down there
and I'm going to talk to them,

399
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:30,166
and if I get a bad vibe,
I-I'm going to say, "No.

400
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,916
We're not comfortable
with this arrangement."

401
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,042
Okay? But if things are cool,
I say we let them stay.

402
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,167
I wish I had your faith in people.

403
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:53,542
My own signature cocktail.
Happy to make you one.

404
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,542
Yeah, you know, I might have a drink.

405
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,916
Haven't touched
this one yet, it's all yours.

406
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,125
Oh, thank you.

407
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:03,667
How about you, Amanda?

408
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06,208
What's in it, exactly?

409
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:10,958
That is a heck of a cocktail.

410
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:12,833
You should try this, babe.
I think you'd dig it.

411
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:14,875
I'll pass.

412
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,458
I think I need some fresh air.

413
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:29,708
Um...

414
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:32,917
You have a beautiful home.

415
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,667
We love it. Glad to hear you do, too.

416
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,124
How long have you been here?

417
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,792
Oh... Bought it almost...

418
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:41,958
...twenty years ago now.

419
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:44,083
But, at this point, it's... it's home.

420
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:46,583
Or a home away from home.

421
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:50,416
We fixed it up about five years back.
We had a great contractor.

422
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,624
- A lot of little details were his idea.
- Hmm.

423
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:55,041
Whereabouts is your place in the city?

424
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:57,833
We are on Park between 81st and 82nd.

425
00:28:58,542 --> 00:28:59,416
What about you?

426
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,708
Uh, Brooklyn. Sunset Park.

427
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:03,499
Well, it's actually Park Slope.

428
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:05,583
- Ah, very nice.
- Mm-hmm.

429
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,500
That's where everyone
wants to live these days. Affordable, too.

430
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:11,958
I think even Ruth looked over there

431
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,792
when she was thinking about flying the coop.

432
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:18,042
Where's your wife? I'm curious if you're
worried about her in the city.

433
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,625
She's on a work trip in Morocco.

434
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,416
She's an art dealer so she travels a lot.

435
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,624
Her flight is due back here
in the morning, actually.

436
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:27,708
Uh-huh.

437
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,958
Could I see your ID?

438
00:29:30,042 --> 00:29:30,916
Oh, Amanda.

439
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,333
It's a fair ask.

440
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:34,624
You're a stranger showing up
in the middle of the night

441
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,208
and my kids are upstairs.

442
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:38,167
Of course. I understand.

443
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,667
Mm, well.

444
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:50,500
You're not going to believe this but I...

445
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:55,374
left my wallet in my coat pocket,
which I checked at the symphony.

446
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,833
In all the commotion,
I must have forgotten it there.

447
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:02,583
You said you heard about the blackout
while you were on your way home.

448
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,583
<i>This is a national emergency.</i>

449
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:17,333
<i>All radio stations and televisions will
cease their programs during this alert.</i>

450
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:18,624
<i>This is a national emergency...</i>

451
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:22,167
Well. Looks like you did the right thing
getting out of the city.

452
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,124
I'm sure it's a mess.

453
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,333
Well, we're only talking
about a blackout here.

454
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:31,041
A blackout is not nothing.

455
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:34,958
It could be something. The symptom
of something bigger, like terrorism

456
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,416
or a bomb like the one that you said
your son would sleep through.

457
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,124
Ruth.

458
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:43,124
<i>...all radio stations
and television networks will cease...</i>

459
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,166
I think that you should stay here tonight.

460
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,208
<i>...this is a national emergency...</i>

461
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:49,458
Tomorrow, we'll sort through everything.

462
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:52,250
Things always look different
by the light of day.

463
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,667
I guess self-help clichés are rooted in some truth, huh?

464
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,208
I can't believe
we're staying in the basement.

465
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:13,583
What do we get to do tomorrow?
Their laundry?

466
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,792
I'll take the floor. You take the bed.

467
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,292
We need to get them out of here.

468
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:38,208
We're not going to do that by scaring them.

469
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,083
They need to think
everything's going to be okay.

470
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:46,583
Everything is going to be okay, isn't it?

471
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,542
What's going on?
What are you thinking?

472
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:03,667
Your client didn't tell you
anything else, did he?

473
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:07,500
There's no point in talking about this
until we know more.

474
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,833
That's what I think.

475
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:23,374
<i>This is a national emergency.</i>

476
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:28,124
<i>All radio stations and televisions will
cease their programs during this alert.</i>

477
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,208
<i>This is a national emergency.</i>

478
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:34,708
<i>All radio stations and televisions will
cease their programs during this alert.</i>

479
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,166
She was fucking with us.

480
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,583
That girl. She was poking.

481
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,624
Don't take it so personal.

482
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:48,000
I don't think I can listen to
much more of that snark.

483
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,749
Even if this does turn out
to be their house.

484
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:51,958
Are we still on that?

485
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,791
Well, there is not one photo on the wall.

486
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:58,583
Not a wedding picture of the supposed
art dealer wife on the business trip

487
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,833
or that spoiled brat as a baby.
Think about it.

488
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:05,583
I'm sure they take them down when they rent the house for privacy concerns.

489
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,541
There's just something off about them.

490
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,666
Why didn't you say anything about
what we saw at the beach today? That boat.

491
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,042
It was an oil tanker.

492
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:19,875
Well, why didn't you? Tell them, I mean.

493
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:25,500
I don't know.
Just seemed like it was piling on.

494
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,375
Why didn't you?

495
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:30,958
I was afraid.

496
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:33,500
Afraid of what?

497
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:36,958
That it would confirm something.

498
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:50,583
<i>All radio stations and televisions will
cease their programs during this alert.</i>

499
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:53,416
<i>This is a national emergency.</i>

500
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,833
<i>All radio stations and televisions will
cease their programs during this alert.</i>

501
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,124
<i>This is a national...</i>

502
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:28,667
<i>Mom.</i>

503
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:30,417
<i>Mom.</i>

504
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:32,708
Mom.

505
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:34,666
Rosie. Rose.

506
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,958
Mom, two problems. One: I was literally
about to start the <i>Friends</i> series finale,

507
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:41,749
but the internet on my iPad
still isn't working.

508
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:45,416
I tried to watch it on the TV
because I read somewhere that they--

509
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,167
What's it called when they used to play
old things over and over again?

510
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:51,458
Reruns.

511
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,542
Why do they do that again?

512
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,750
I don't know, Rosie.
We were really bored back then.

513
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:00,791
Anyway, th-there's something wrong
with the TV. It's all messed up.

514
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,666
That's problem number two.
Please fix this.

515
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,791
I have incredible anxiety about
how they're going to wrap up the show.

516
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:09,333
Don't you think you're taking this
a little too seriously?

517
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,999
This isn't fair. It's a vacation.

518
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:15,249
Dad said on vacation we can have
as much screen time as we want.

519
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,708
Well. A: <i>I</i> did not say that.

520
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:22,417
And B: Daddy is still sleeping.

521
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,583
Just go wait in the living room.
I'm coming.

522
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:50,500
Clay.

523
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:54,167
Get up. Look. Look.

524
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,417
- It doesn't say anything.
- What?

525
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,542
- It was just there.
- Mm, you sure? What did it say?

526
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,792
Yes, of course I'm sure.

527
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,083
There were four news alerts. Um...

528
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,458
Uh, two about the blackout
and one that said, um...

529
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:16,374
hackers were behind the power outage.

530
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,124
- Hackers?
- Yeah.

531
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:21,833
And then there was one that said, uh,
"breaking" but then it was just gibberish.

532
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:23,916
No words, just random letters.

533
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,500
Maybe they hacked the cell network?

534
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,958
Is that-Is that a question?

535
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:32,624
Are you fucking asking me?
How would I know?

536
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,374
Why are you being
so nonplussed about all of this?

537
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,999
Did you forget those people
are still in our house?

538
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:40,750
I trusted you to handle this.

539
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:42,999
I'm gonna drive into town.

540
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,708
I'll go to the store, buy a newspaper,

541
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:48,249
find someone who knows more than we do.

542
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,750
All right?
I will take care of this for us.

543
00:36:58,708 --> 00:36:59,708
Whose car is that?

544
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,042
Looks expensive.

545
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:04,792
Let's get some breakfast.

546
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,792
Uh, so listen, honey. About that car.

547
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:19,458
Last night, these people...

548
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:23,291
...the Scotts. They had to come by.

549
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,375
There's been...

550
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:27,083
...um, they had a problem

551
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,833
and they weren't far from here.
So they, they came here.

552
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,583
What are you even talking about?

553
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,958
I'll take some of that coffee.

554
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,292
Oh. I was just telling Rose
about the Scotts.

555
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,791
- Dad, the TV isn't working.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, baby.

556
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:39,874
- Come on.
- Dad, can you fix it?

557
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,291
Uh...

558
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,291
Yeah.

559
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,208
Um...

560
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:47,667
Well, now it's snow.
Last night it was a blue screen.

561
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,083
- I wonder what that means.
- What?

562
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,542
Yeah, see?

563
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,458
No. It's just- it's not working.

564
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,958
I'm aware. Can you like,
reboot it or something?

565
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:02,124
- Or go up on the roof or whatever?
- No one's going on the roof.

566
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,374
I am definitely not going up on the roof.

567
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,791
Okay? But I'm going
to go to the store later

568
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,374
and maybe I can find something
that will, you know, help.

569
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:12,166
You know, get one of those, uh,
some rabbit ears or something.

570
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,000
Why would a rabbit's ear help?

571
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:44,125
Good morning.

572
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:46,374
You mind if I have some coffee?

573
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,917
Help yourself.
You know where the mugs are, right?

574
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,666
I had news alerts
on my phone this morning.

575
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,333
- Your phone is working?
- No.

576
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:03,083
They must have come in overnight somehow,
and then they disappeared.

577
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:05,458
What did they say?

578
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:10,749
There were two about the blackout and then
something about hackers being behind it.

579
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:11,833
- Hackers?
- Mm-hmm.

580
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,708
Where are the power plants
in New York City?

581
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:17,333
I mean, they must be in Queens, I guess.
Or-Or near the river?

582
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,333
Why are you asking about power plants?

583
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,833
Hackers can get into power plants.

584
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:22,749
That's probably how
they caused the outage.

585
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:25,041
You remember that thing
that happened in Jersey a few years back?

586
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:26,667
It nearly caused a meltdown.

587
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,250
Is that your daughter out there?

588
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:35,417
She's sweet. How old is she?

589
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,958
Thirteen, last month.

590
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:39,249
Hmm.

591
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,083
Still kind of a baby at heart.

592
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,749
If it's okay with you, I would like to
keep what's going on between the adults.

593
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:48,166
The kids like the pool.

594
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,124
I'm just going to encourage them
to do that until we know more.

595
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,999
I don't want them to panic over nothing.

596
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,708
I don't want to scare anyone
but I disagree with you.

597
00:40:56,917 --> 00:40:58,708
Disagree with me about what?

598
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,375
I don't think this is nothing.

599
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:09,875
So, what is it that you do?

600
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,250
Um...

601
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:17,417
I'm in advertising, on the client side.
I manage relationships.

602
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,958
Huh. I would not have guessed that.

603
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,458
And what about your husband?

604
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:26,291
Uh, Clay is a professor at City College.

605
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:28,416
English and media studies.

606
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,624
You know, I've had plenty of friends
major in media studies

607
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:33,500
but I never know what it means.

608
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:36,875
And you, what is it that you do?

609
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,749
Me, I'm...

610
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,874
I'm still figuring my shit out,
trying not to rush into anything.

611
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,708
The last thing that I want
is to be sucked into a career

612
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:46,999
that I regret ten years from now

613
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,999
by which point I will be trapped
by the pressure to stay the course

614
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,833
because I'll be too old to re-enter
the workforce. You know what I mean.

615
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,792
Morning. Any news?

616
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,833
Phone's still not working.

617
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,416
Looks like the TV's out. Where's Clay?

618
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,499
He went to the store to get a newspaper.

619
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:08,541
Or try to find someone to talk to,
to see if they know what's going on.

620
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:12,500
Smart. I thought I'd go over
to our neighbors house, the Huxleys.

621
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:16,124
- They only live a few miles down the road.
- And you think they'll be home?

622
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,666
Unlikely.

623
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,749
You often see no one here
around this time,

624
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,417
but I'll drive over anyway and check.

625
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:25,083
Before you go, you might
want to hear about the alerts.

626
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:28,333
Alerts?

627
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:32,041
Oh, I had news alerts
on my phone this morning.

628
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,291
Two of them were about the blackout

629
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:38,958
but then there was one that said something
about maybe hackers were behind it.

630
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,999
Uh-huh.

631
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,999
What? Do you think
there's going to be a meltdown, too?

632
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:49,541
- Is that what Ruth told you?
- Among other horrifying things, yes.

633
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:52,541
Well, obviously
Ruth is being a little paranoid.

634
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,249
Aren't you the one who always said,

635
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:57,125
"If you're not paranoid by now,
it's probably too late"?

636
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:02,374
I'm sure this'll turn out to be a big nothing.

637
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,542
Like that Love You bug.

638
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,667
Is that coffee?

639
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,375
I-I'm sorry. What's a Love You bug?

640
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:14,749
Um, it was a computer worm.

641
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,333
Spread throughout
the internet back in 2000.

642
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:20,416
People would get an email with
the subject line that read "I love you."

643
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,916
You clicked on the attachment,
it would send it to all your contacts.

644
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,083
It crippled businesses
and caused billions of dollars in damages.

645
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,999
Turns out, it was just
two teenagers in the Philippines.

646
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,333
Could be just as innocent as that.

647
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,667
I think I'll go rush Archie along.

648
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,667
I'm worried about Mom.

649
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:07,792
You think her flight is going to be okay?

650
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:12,125
Sure.

651
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:17,167
Matter of fact, I bet she's...

652
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:20,583
...been redirected to some airport in Ohio.

653
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,874
She's probably cursing out
every customer service rep

654
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:26,333
till they put her on a plane home.

655
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,000
Do you remember that time
the three of us went to Italy?

656
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:35,792
Yeah, I do.

657
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,333
What made you think of that?

658
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:44,583
I don't know what else to think about.

659
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,750
Yeah.

660
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:24,417
<i>♪ Oh, it's the winter of the wanted ♪</i>

661
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,833
<i>♪ Yeah, it's the hardest part of nature ♪</i>

662
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:31,500
<i>♪ Lord have mercy on this creature ♪</i>

663
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:34,667
<i>♪ Give me some heat
I know you've got it ♪</i>

664
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,208
Who'd Mom say these people were again?

665
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:48,917
What're you looking at?

666
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:26,874
<i>...we're now getting reports</i>

667
00:48:26,958 --> 00:48:28,916
<i>that the fallout
from the ongoing Cyber attack</i>

668
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,083

environmental disaster in the South,</i>

669
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:34,499
<i>impacting animal migration patterns--</i>

670
00:49:39,792 --> 00:49:41,875
Archie, I saw something this morning.

671
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,041
Deer.

672
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:45,750
They're everywhere, dumbass.

673
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:49,624
They're like squirrels or pigeons.

674
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:50,916
Who cares?

675
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,625
No, this was different. Like...

676
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:55,042
...they were trying to tell us something.

677
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:58,625
Let's see what else is out there.

678
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:02,666
Are you really that bored?

679
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,833
Is this because you can't watch your show?

680
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:06,625
I'm going.

681
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:24,792
Hello, anyone home?
It's G.H. I let myself in.

682
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:58,417
Hello?

683
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,167
What's in that thing?

684
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:10,417
Let's open it and see.

685
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:44,249
- Yeah? Hey, hi.
- Hello!

686
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:53,791
Okay, I-I don't understand what you're
saying. I don't, I don't speak, um...

687
00:51:53,875 --> 00:51:55,125
I don't speak Spanish.

688
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:15,000
This place is so fucking boring.

689
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:18,125
Yeah.

690
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,750
Maybe it's just where he sleeps, though.

691
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:29,875
Where he hides at night.

692
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:31,917
Who?

693
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:35,083
Whoever made that impression.

694
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,833
I-I don't, I don't know where I am.
I'm trying to get to town.

695
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:21,458
No, no, I-I don't have any service either.

696
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,583
Listen, listen...

697
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,417
Look, he's, uh...

698
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:35,792
He's got this little window over here.

699
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:38,375
So he can see...

700
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:40,958
See what?

701
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:46,125
No, o-okay. Okay. I-I...

702
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,917
Sorry.

703
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:55,958
Hey.

704
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,500
Isn't that the room you were sleeping in?

705
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:35,041
Shit...

706
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,708
Just imagine.

707
00:55:49,792 --> 00:55:51,375
It's all dark out here.

708
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:06,667
Oh, my God.

709
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,292
Your little bedside lamp is glowing.

710
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:24,250
Oh, shit.

711
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:28,416
Oh, shit!

712
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,833
He could just
follow that light right up to you.

713
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:43,583
Oh, shit.

714
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:48,208
Ah!

715
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:50,541
That's not funny, Archie.
That really hurt.

716
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:51,583
You'll be fine.

717
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:52,708
No, I won't.

718
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:55,417
Dude, calm the fuck down.
It was just a joke.

719
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:00,333
This morning I saw deer.

720
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,499
Not a deer, a fuck lot of deer. A hundred.

721
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:06,499
Maybe more. Right in the backyard.

722
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:08,583
It was really weird, Archie.

723
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:10,917
Do they go around in big groups like that?

724
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:13,750
Why the fuck would I know
anything about deer?

725
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:17,958
If you're so worried about it,
why don't you just ask Mom and Dad?

726
00:57:18,042 --> 00:57:19,792
Like they would even care.

727
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,458
No one cares what I say.

728
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:28,708
That's probably true.

729
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:20,292
You going in?

730
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:22,667
No. You?

731
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,874
Seems like a hassle.

732
00:58:25,958 --> 00:58:28,000
Why? Because of your hair, or...?

733
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:34,292
More like I don't trust that
one of your kids didn't pee in the pool.

734
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,958
They wouldn't do that.

735
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:40,000
And yet, we really can't know, can we?

736
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:53,292
Your daughter watches that show?

737
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:58,750
"Watch" is far too weak of a word. More like worships.

738
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:01,708
Hmm.

739
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:03,750
What?

740
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,541
Don't get me wrong, I watched it too.

741
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:12,583
But it's almost... nostalgic
for a time that never existed, you know?

742
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,583
I hope the kids didn't wander off too far.

743
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,292
Fuck...

744
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:40,875
Archie.

745
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:44,292
Archie, look.

746
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,000
Will you please look?

747
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,292
What?

748
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:57,292
We should go up there.

749
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,667
No. No, fuck that. I'm hungry.
Come on, let's go.

750
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,375
Rose, let's go.

751
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:25,208
So...

752
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:28,167
You going to tell us
why you're soaking wet?

753
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:33,792
I fell into the pool.

754
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:37,375
You fell into the... pool.

755
01:00:38,042 --> 01:00:39,624
I tripped over something.

756
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:41,458
Yeah, I fell into the pool.

757
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:44,124
What were you doing near the pool?
I thought you were looking for Rich.

758
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:46,875
Do you mind going to my study
and getting me something to wear?

759
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:50,458
I'm afraid this is the only
change of clothes I had downstairs.

760
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:02,792
I saw it, you know?

761
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:06,458
A while ago, before all this happened.

762
01:01:08,792 --> 01:01:10,167
I looked at the market.

763
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:13,208
And I knew something was coming.

764
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:17,083
What do you mean?

765
01:01:21,167 --> 01:01:25,333
In my line of work, you have to understand
the patterns that govern the world.

766
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,167
You have to learn how to read the curve.

767
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:32,374
Spend as long as I have doing it,
it can help you see the future.

768
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:35,874
It holds steady, it promises harmony.

769
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,958
It inches up or down,
you know that means something.

770
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,500
G.H., why-why are you telling me this?

771
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,250
Did your neighbor say something to you?

772
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,791
No, he wasn't home.

773
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,625
But he has a satellite phone
I thought could help us.

774
01:01:56,458 --> 01:02:00,333
I tried to use it. It didn't work
even though it had enough juice.

775
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:04,124
Now, the whole point of a satellite phone
is that you always have a signal

776
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:06,542
if you have a clear view of the sky,
which I did.

777
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,208
Only reason why it wouldn't work

778
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:12,583
is if our satellites
got knocked out of commission.

779
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:16,708
Our satellites.

780
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:22,624
You think something happened
to our satellites. The ones in space.

781
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:25,333
Satellites are networked
to computers down here.

782
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,750
Mm...

783
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:34,792
So you think that the hackers or whatever
knocked out our satellites?

784
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,833
Don't you think you're maybe
getting a little carried away?

785
01:02:38,917 --> 01:02:40,333
I mean, maybe you just
didn't use the phone right.

786
01:02:40,417 --> 01:02:43,708
I saw a plane nosedive
out of the sky into the ocean.

787
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:51,583
And it wasn't the first.

788
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:05,167
I no longer think that this is just
a couple of teenagers in the Philippines.

789
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:14,999
What the fuck?

790
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:18,250
What the fuck?

791
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:27,583
Where are my kids?

792
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:00,667
Mommy.

793
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,333
Where's Dad?

794
01:05:09,042 --> 01:05:10,000
He'll be back soon.

795
01:05:11,792 --> 01:05:12,792
Why are you wet?

796
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:16,958
I should have covered my ears sooner.

797
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:18,583
Now my head feels weird.

798
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:22,667
That's probably normal.
It was really loud.

799
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:30,999
Was it like a, um, like a-a plane
breaking the sound barrier?

800
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:35,124
Or whatever that-- a sonic boom.
Was, was that a sonic boom?

801
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:37,833
Planes don't usually
break the sound barrier.

802
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:40,416
The Concorde doesn't fly anymore.

803
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,625
Maybe it was a plane
that we don't know about.

804
01:05:44,917 --> 01:05:46,792
Archie, why don't you go get changed.

805
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:49,667
Rose, maybe you should too.

806
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:52,541
That's a good idea.

807
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:55,208
Why don't you go cuddle up in Mommy's bed and read that book Dad got you.

808
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,208
We're, um, we're going to be okay, right?

809
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:08,500
Yeah.

810
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:19,124
Since you're the one
with the crystal ball, what was that?

811
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,999
Was that a bomb? A missile?

812
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:23,208
Could have been a power plant explosion.

813
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:24,833
We don't know anything for certain yet.

814
01:06:24,917 --> 01:06:28,833
You seemed pretty certain a minute ago
with your fucking haunting soliloquy.

815
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:30,083
Nothing's changed.

816
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:33,625
Nothing's changed?

817
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:37,499
Everything has changed.

818
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:40,083
And we're sitting here like...
like I don't know what.

819
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:43,333
Is-Is this what sitting ducks are?
Ducks sitting and waiting to be shot?

820
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,792
I meant nothing has changed
in terms of what we do.

821
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:49,541
We wait for Clay to come back
and we see what he's learned.

822
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:51,791
Should I drive to town and look for him?

823
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,458
We should fill the bathtubs full of water.

824
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:57,541
Is there enough batteries, and Tylenol,
and food, and the generator,

825
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:59,999
and one of those hand crank radios,

826
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,041
and a straw that makes it safe
to drink dirty water.

827
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:03,916
I think we shouldn't do anything
until Clay comes back.

828
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,749
What if he's not coming back?

829
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:07,749
Okay, my dad is right.

830
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:09,583
We're safe here. We should just sit tight.

831
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:10,791
How do you know that we're safe

832
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:12,124
when you don't know
what the fuck is happening to us?

833
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,541
Maybe it was like,
what was that? Ten Mile Island?

834
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:16,791
There are power plants here, aren't there?

835
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:19,291
- Three Mile Island.
- Why are you obsessed with power plants?

836
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:21,791
Hey, you're right. We shouldn't speculate.

837
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:22,958
Stop saying that!

838
01:07:23,042 --> 01:07:25,916
I just want you to fucking
tell me what you're thinking.

839
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,500
There's the blackout
and then you see the planes crashing and...

840
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:32,417
What?

841
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:34,541
What? She's an adult.

842
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:37,250
You cannot protect her,
just like you cannot protect me right now.

843
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:42,166
The satellite phone not working
and then that noise, and then what?

844
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,458
What happens next in that sequence?

845
01:07:44,542 --> 01:07:46,208
Everything I know I have told you.

846
01:07:46,292 --> 01:07:47,874
I don't believe you.

847
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:50,624
I haven't believed you
since you walked through that front door.

848
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:54,166
Golly. I wonder what it is about us
that makes you so mistrustful.

849
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,124
Ruth...

850
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:58,333
You always think you know
what you're talking about, don't you?

851
01:07:58,417 --> 01:08:00,874
Well, ain't that the pot calling the kettle black?

852
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:02,458
Ruth.

853
01:08:33,417 --> 01:08:34,333
He knew.

854
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:38,833
At the market in town yesterday,

855
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:40,916
there was a guy in the parking lot.

856
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,875
He bought cases of water and canned goods.

857
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:52,792
He knew this was going to happen.

858
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:55,375
Bearded guy?

859
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:58,792
Probably wearing an old Cowboys hat.

860
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:01,958
That's Danny.

861
01:09:02,042 --> 01:09:04,208
He's the contractor
I was telling you about.

862
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:07,667
The one who worked on the house.

863
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,249
I wouldn't read into it.

864
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:11,916
He's a self-proclaimed survivalist.

865
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,917
That shopping list was probably
a typical weekend for him.

866
01:09:19,042 --> 01:09:20,417
Jesus Christ.

867
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:25,083
I'm here. I'm okay, are you okay?
Where are the kids?

868
01:09:25,167 --> 01:09:27,291
- Everyone's here, everyone's okay.
- Okay.

869
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:28,749
What happened? Did you get to town?

870
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:31,167
Uh... Uh...

871
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,833
I didn't get far.
And then I heard that noise.

872
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,041
What do you mean?
Where have you been?

873
01:09:39,125 --> 01:09:40,791
What were you doing? I was going crazy.

874
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:44,416
I don't know, I-I just started to drive,

875
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:48,833
and then I heard that noise,
and I came right back.

876
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:52,708
So you didn't see anyone that might
help us figure out what's happening here.

877
01:09:52,792 --> 01:09:54,375
No, I did not see anyone.

878
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:58,000
But I did see something. I saw--

879
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,292
Um, I, uh--

880
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:03,791
It was this huge, um, drone.

881
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:06,958
You know, flying in the middle of nowhere,
dropping off thousands of these.

882
01:10:07,042 --> 01:10:08,708
I have no idea what it says.

883
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,667
"Death to America."

884
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:26,208
What?

885
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,917
"Death to America."

886
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:34,749
I mean, I don't know
what the rest of this means,

887
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:37,500
but this part,
it definitely means "Death to America."

888
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:40,000
I remember from a game I was playing.

889
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:47,791
Nothing about this makes sense.

890
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:50,333
If they were attacking us,
why would they advertise it like this?

891
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:53,208
It's not even in English. What's the point
of dropping these things here?

892
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:55,124
I'm pretty sure I make that first right,

893
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:56,999
then it's a straight shot
to the expressway?

894
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:59,833
With what we know, the city would be
the worst place for you to go.

895
01:10:59,917 --> 01:11:02,958
We're not going to the city.
We're going to my sister's in Jersey.

896
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:05,874
But to get to New Jersey from here,
you have to drive through the city.

897
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:09,208
But to be clear, I make a right,
follow signs to the Expressway.

898
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:12,583
Yes, exactly like how you got here.
But listen to me, please.

899
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:15,124
This is dangerous what you're doing,
for you and your family.

900
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:16,042
Dad.

901
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:18,000
Let them go.

902
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:23,249
I really appreciate
you taking care of us, I do.

903
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,458
We have to do what's right for our family.

904
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:27,875
This is in everyone's best interest.

905
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:44,667
This is for the better.

906
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:48,958
For who?

907
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:51,875
For us.

908
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:01,666
I don't want to have to agree
with that woman, but she was right.

909
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,749
And you really
should've told me what you saw.

910
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,333
Hey, I know what you're thinking,

911
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:07,833
but I'm certain your mother's plane
wouldn't be flying over here.

912
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:09,500
It wasn't the same airline.

913
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:14,208
Is she gone?

914
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:17,208
Oh, come on now.
Why are you even going there?

915
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:19,624
I just told you,
it wasn't even the same airline.

916
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:21,500
Yeah, but does it feel like she's gone?

917
01:12:24,792 --> 01:12:26,625
Because it does to me.

918
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:35,124
If we hit traffic, at least
we'll be able to talk to people,

919
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:37,333
see if anyone has information
about what's going on.

920
01:12:37,417 --> 01:12:39,125
It's crazy we haven't seen anyone.

921
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:43,250
I'm sure we will see someone
as soon as we hit the Expressway.

922
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:46,624
Phones could work in New Jersey.

923
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:49,874
The truth is we don't know anything
that's going on outside of Long Island.

924
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:52,667
They could have internet,
the phone lines could be okay.

925
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:56,583
We'll look back on this one day
and laugh, I guarantee you.

926
01:12:56,667 --> 01:12:59,249
The vacation from Hell.

927
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,542
Things get funnier with time.
Isn't that what they say?

928
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,041
I think they say it a little differently.

929
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:06,249
But, you know, I know what you mean.

930
01:13:08,042 --> 01:13:09,125
Sirens.

931
01:13:11,292 --> 01:13:12,833
I thought you were napping, honey.

932
01:13:12,917 --> 01:13:13,999
I can't.

933
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,250
Why not?

934
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,124
Because of the sirens.

935
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:21,667
What is that?

936
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,666
You stay with the kids.
I'm gonna go take a look.

937
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:29,124
You know what, you guys, sit--

938
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:30,542
Sit tight, okay?

939
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:33,416
See anyone?

940
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:36,750
There's nobody here.

941
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:46,792
They're all brand new.

942
01:14:47,292 --> 01:14:48,292
What?

943
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:53,583
Oh, wow. Hey, someone's coming.

944
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:55,000
Yo!

945
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:14,833
Clay!

946
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:18,291
- Clay, get in the car!
- Wait, shouldn't we wait and talk to them?

947
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:20,916
- Get in the fucking car right now!
- All right, all right.

948
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:27,249
What are you doing?
Shouldn't we flag them down?

949
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:29,916
- Maybe they know something.
- There's no one in that car!

950
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:36,833
Mom? Mom, on your left, there's a car!
Go, go, go, go!

951
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:27,792
What if we went to a shelter?

952
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:32,583
Does the military have a bomb shelter
or a base around here?

953
01:16:32,667 --> 01:16:35,083
I mean, don't they
have to have those things ready for...

954
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:37,667
...emergencies like these?

955
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:41,250
I don't know where they are.

956
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:45,917
Even if I did, you said
all those cars came off the lot.

957
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:51,292
If they did that to every dealership,
the main roads are most likely clogged up.

958
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,166
We stay here till we know more.

959
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,458
How much more do we need to know?

960
01:16:55,542 --> 01:16:57,374
We're probably
in the middle of a war zone.

961
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:59,500
People we know are likely dead.

962
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:03,583
Ruth.

963
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:11,958
Just--

964
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,916
We just need to make a plan.

965
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,333
We can't sit here and do nothing.
We need to go somewhere.

966
01:17:16,417 --> 01:17:18,750
He's right, Amanda.
It's too dangerous.

967
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:22,833
We stay here tonight,
and then in the morning, maybe--

968
01:17:22,917 --> 01:17:24,875
- Maybe what?
- Maybe-- I don't know.

969
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:35,333
I was so close.

970
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:21,833
What are you doing?

971
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:25,542
Filling up the tub.

972
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:28,083
That's what they say to do for,

973
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:31,083
you know, water.

974
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:33,750
Do you vape?

975
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,542
Not really.

976
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:38,958
I mean, is that--
That's like, marijuana?

977
01:18:39,042 --> 01:18:42,291
I mean, I know they got different kinds
now, like fruit flavors or--

978
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:43,417
Like marijuana.

979
01:18:49,667 --> 01:18:51,291
Have you ever fucked one of your students?

980
01:18:55,667 --> 01:18:57,583
I can't believe you just asked me that.

981
01:18:57,667 --> 01:19:00,791
I mean, is that what I look like to you?
I look like that kind of guy?

982
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:04,583
You look like the kind of guy
to whom things come easy.

983
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:06,667
Especially women.

984
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:09,917
Well, I'll take that as a compliment,
I guess. Hmm?

985
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,833
I always thought of myself
as a sophisticated man.

986
01:19:35,667 --> 01:19:38,125
Someone who had seen the world
for what it was.

987
01:19:38,792 --> 01:19:41,167
But I have never seen anything like this.

988
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:47,250
So now, I wonder if that thing I always
thought about myself was a delusion.

989
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,208
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

990
01:19:50,292 --> 01:19:52,749
You dig deep enough,
it's probably all a delusion.

991
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:56,000
I mean, take your line of work,
for example.

992
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,749
Imaginary numbers,

993
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:03,124
moving around imaginary money,
leading to imaginary success.

994
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:07,291
Personally, I think my business
is a lot less complicated than all that.

995
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:11,083
At its most basic, my work is
and always has been about people.

996
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:13,958
- I'm real sorry for you then.
- And why is that?

997
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:16,041
Because people are terrible.

998
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:19,042
I mean, fuck.
Look at the way I treated you.

999
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:32,375
And now we are enjoying a drink together.

1000
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:50,125
I am sorry, by the way.

1001
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:55,624
For what I said, did, thought,
it doesn't matter.

1002
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:57,500
I was wrong and I'm sorry.

1003
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:04,249
Some of my smartest clients
have lost a lot of money

1004
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:09,583
because they based their choices
on preconceived beliefs instead of truth.

1005
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:14,875
Seeing the difference is one
of the hardest things a person can do.

1006
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:19,167
When they don't and you do,
gotta be maddening.

1007
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,708
Depending on the person,

1008
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:25,583
I might take a little satisfaction
in watching the market punish them.

1009
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,666
The scary ones, though,
are the ones who don't learn.

1010
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:32,750
Even after they lose lots,
and I mean lots, of money.

1011
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:37,458
Nothing frightens me more
than a person unwilling to learn,

1012
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:38,958
even at their own expense.

1013
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:43,958
That's a darkness I will never understand.

1014
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:56,542
The quiet is so noisy.

1015
01:21:58,542 --> 01:22:01,833
It's one of the first things I noticed
when we started spending nights here.

1016
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,125
Found it hard to sleep.

1017
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:07,500
Not like at home,
where you hear everything.

1018
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:11,500
Sirens, traffic, people.

1019
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:14,125
I miss that.

1020
01:22:14,917 --> 01:22:16,583
Which, the sirens or the people?

1021
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:25,625
I am starting to like you,

1022
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:28,917
and that is a bold statement
coming from me because...

1023
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:33,167
I can't remember
the last time I liked anybody.

1024
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:37,458
I have to say, I found you
very prickly at the outset,

1025
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:38,958
but you've grown on me.

1026
01:22:48,667 --> 01:22:50,125
Why did you really come here?

1027
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:53,792
And don't tell me
it's because of your knee.

1028
01:22:54,292 --> 01:22:57,374
That wasn't a lie.
I did have a knee surgery.

1029
01:22:57,458 --> 01:23:00,583
Twisted it up pretty bad
playing ball down at the Y.

1030
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:02,542
But it's not why you came here.

1031
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:13,042
Why I came here involves something
that happened to me a few years back.

1032
01:23:15,917 --> 01:23:19,292
One of my clients invited me
and my wife to a private event.

1033
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,333
My client, he...

1034
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:23,375
Well.

1035
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:28,375
I won't say his name,
but you'd recognize it though.

1036
01:23:28,958 --> 01:23:31,499
- Is he a celebrity?
- Oh, no. Nothing like that.

1037
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:34,625
But in the business world,
he's one of the biggest out there.

1038
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:39,291
He deals mostly in defense contracting.

1039
01:23:39,375 --> 01:23:43,458
I'm talking hush-hush,
top-secret money from the Pentagon.

1040
01:23:43,542 --> 01:23:46,166
Perhaps the most powerful person
I've ever had a meal with.

1041
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:49,999
Anyway, we're at this soiree at his house.

1042
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:53,166
It's getting late.
My wife, she wants to go.

1043
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:57,166
But he and I are just having a blast,
and he doesn't want the night to end.

1044
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:59,583
After a few more glares,

1045
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:03,291
my wife agrees to take a cab
and I'll come home after.

1046
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:05,708
Mm, I bet she was real happy about that.

1047
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:07,124
Mm-hmm.

1048
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:12,083
So, we're having a few more drinks,
getting really sauced, and at one point,

1049
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:15,999
I don't think he could stand
and I was pretty wobbly, myself.

1050
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:18,124
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.

1051
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:22,833
So he takes me to his study.

1052
01:24:22,917 --> 01:24:24,666
Smoke a few cigars

1053
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:28,958
and we're sort of flying high,
laughing at almost everything.

1054
01:24:29,042 --> 01:24:31,374
Eventually he starts in
on how much he likes me,

1055
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:35,083
and how he wishes he could invite me
on this trip he's about to go on.

1056
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:37,999
What kind of trip? Where is he going?

1057
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:40,208
That's exactly what I asked.

1058
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:42,875
Then he...

1059
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:45,458
turns to me,

1060
01:24:45,542 --> 01:24:46,792
serious face.

1061
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:49,958
And he says...

1062
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,166
"Oh, you know,

1063
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:53,791
"just my annual meeting

1064
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:56,750
with the rest of the evil cabal
that runs the world."

1065
01:25:02,208 --> 01:25:04,874
He was the kind of guy
that was always known for jokes like that.

1066
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:07,958
Again, if I told you his name,
you would understand.

1067
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:10,624
Well, I just have
to take your word for it.

1068
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:13,792
And now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna top off my wine.

1069
01:25:15,792 --> 01:25:19,041
Then yesterday, before the symphony,

1070
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:20,625
my friend calls me up.

1071
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,166
No scheduled appointment,
like he usually does.

1072
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,833
Just calls me out of the blue

1073
01:25:27,917 --> 01:25:30,208
and wants me to move around
some of his money.

1074
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:34,292
And we're talking some big numbers,
even for him.

1075
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:39,874
And as we're getting off the phone,
I asked if he wanted to grab a drink.

1076
01:25:39,958 --> 01:25:42,167
He tells me he's going away for a while.

1077
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,916
And I joke back to him,

1078
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,333
"Oh, yeah? You hanging
with your evil cabal this weekend?

1079
01:25:48,417 --> 01:25:50,458
I thought that was only
during the winter solstice."

1080
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:56,083
But he doesn't laugh.

1081
01:25:57,667 --> 01:26:00,292
And he always laughs, even with bad jokes.

1082
01:26:02,125 --> 01:26:03,292
All he said was...

1083
01:26:04,917 --> 01:26:06,208
"Take care of yourself."

1084
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,750
Almost as if he felt sorry for me.

1085
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,000
Ever since, I haven't been
able to get it out of my head.

1086
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:23,833
Are you saying that--

1087
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:27,833
Are you thinking that your friend
is somehow behind what's happening here?

1088
01:26:27,917 --> 01:26:29,083
No, nothing like that.

1089
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:32,499
A conspiracy theory about a shadowy
group of people running the world

1090
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:34,750
is far too lazy of an explanation.

1091
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,000
Especially when the truth is much scarier.

1092
01:26:40,167 --> 01:26:41,667
What is the truth?

1093
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:44,374
No one is in control.

1094
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:46,333
No one is pulling the strings.

1095
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:49,291
Sure, there are those like my friend

1096
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:53,374
who might have the right kind of access
to the right kind of information.

1097
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,583
But when events like this
happen in the world,

1098
01:26:56,667 --> 01:27:00,416
the best, even the most powerful people can hope for is a heads up.

1099
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,250
is a heads up.

1100
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:12,292
Sorry, this...

1101
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:15,750
Guess this story's kind of a buzzkill.

1102
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:21,208
Changed my mind.
I don't think I like you anymore.

1103
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:30,333
Come on.

1104
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:32,958
Let's go.

1105
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:34,916
Where are we going?

1106
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,458
I'm gonna win you over again.

1107
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:42,417
I see you, Rose.

1108
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:48,542
What do you want?

1109
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:53,791
I'm never going to find out what happens
to Ross and Rachel, am I?

1110
01:27:53,875 --> 01:27:55,624
You're still on this shit?

1111
01:27:55,708 --> 01:27:57,083
Who gives a fuck?

1112
01:27:57,167 --> 01:27:59,916
Well, I do. Obviously.

1113
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,042
Why do you care so much
about that show anyway?

1114
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,833
They make me happy.

1115
01:28:08,042 --> 01:28:10,333
I really need that right now. Don't you?

1116
01:28:17,833 --> 01:28:20,124
If there's any hope left
in this fucked up world,

1117
01:28:20,208 --> 01:28:22,917
I wanna at least find out
how things turn out for them.

1118
01:28:28,417 --> 01:28:29,625
I care about them.

1119
01:28:32,792 --> 01:28:33,917
Maybe you shouldn't.

1120
01:28:35,042 --> 01:28:36,083
I'm just saying.

1121
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:39,749
You're probably right,
the way things are going

1122
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:42,042
you're not gonna see that show ever again.

1123
01:28:43,125 --> 01:28:45,958
So if I were you,
I'd find something else to care about.

1124
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:55,041
It's weird, we're not hearing
any cicadas tonight.

1125
01:28:58,417 --> 01:28:59,458
I got lost today.

1126
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:03,292
When I went out this morning.

1127
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:06,874
What do you mean you got lost?

1128
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:08,666
Well,

1129
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,416
I thought I knew where I was going

1130
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,833
but then there were all these streets
that didn't have any signs anywhere.

1131
01:29:14,458 --> 01:29:16,917
So I just drove around.

1132
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:19,542
Then I drove around some more.

1133
01:29:20,833 --> 01:29:25,666
And then, you know, I turn around,
and then I got just completely lost,

1134
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:28,542
and I have no idea how I found
my way back here, to be honest.

1135
01:29:33,625 --> 01:29:35,208
But I did see someone.

1136
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:40,708
A woman.

1137
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:43,208
On the road.

1138
01:29:45,042 --> 01:29:48,250
She waved me down and, um,

1139
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:50,542
she was speaking Spanish.

1140
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:53,249
She was just standing there

1141
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:55,958
by the side of the road
in the middle of nowhere.

1142
01:29:56,042 --> 01:29:57,042
And I...

1143
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:00,250
I left her.

1144
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:03,917
She needed help.

1145
01:30:05,417 --> 01:30:06,417
And I left her.

1146
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,583
Well, is there anything else
that you're keeping from us?

1147
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:28,042
Since you're opening up, that is.

1148
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:35,958
Well, we didn't tell you before
that we saw an oil tanker ground.

1149
01:30:36,042 --> 01:30:38,083
Like, right up on the beach.

1150
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:39,499
An oil tanker?

1151
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:42,916
Yeah, it's like a really big boat.

1152
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,249
You know, it's red.

1153
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:47,916
I mean, well,
I don't think that they're all red,

1154
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,833
but this one was,
and it came right up on the beach.

1155
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,249
Why didn't you tell us?

1156
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:57,542
Well, I think at the time
we were both scared, you know?

1157
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:01,542
About what it could mean.

1158
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,042
Well, what could it mean?

1159
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,499
Well, if we were being attacked,

1160
01:31:06,583 --> 01:31:10,333
which I know sounds weird to say,
but oil is something

1161
01:31:10,417 --> 01:31:11,749
that you would want a lot of

1162
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,749
if, you know,
we're going to defend ourselves.

1163
01:31:13,833 --> 01:31:15,791
I cannot believe
we're having this conversation.

1164
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:18,041
I really think we're gonna be all right.

1165
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:20,874
You know, I mean, in the end, I really do.

1166
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:22,833
I mean, even if it is like, an invasion.

1167
01:31:22,917 --> 01:31:23,749
An invasion?

1168
01:31:23,833 --> 01:31:25,458
Well, or an occupation?

1169
01:31:25,542 --> 01:31:27,999
Okay, dude, you know what?
I know that you mean well,

1170
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:31,749
but your word choices are, like,
freaking me the fuck out.

1171
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
What was that?

1172
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:57,375
Those are... flamingos.

1173
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:00,417
Those are flamingos?

1174
01:32:02,042 --> 01:32:03,583
Those are flamingos.

1175
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:08,292
Why?

1176
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:13,833
Wow, this is an impressive collection.

1177
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:16,958
You like jazz?

1178
01:32:18,542 --> 01:32:20,416
You want to listen to jazz?

1179
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,041
Sure, why not?

1180
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:25,041
Because I thought
we were going to have some fun.

1181
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:28,333
Let's have something we could dance to.

1182
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:30,166
You can dance to jazz.

1183
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:32,249
In fact, when I bought
my first record, that was--

1184
01:32:32,333 --> 01:32:34,416
Oh, please
not another one of your stories.

1185
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:38,083
They end up leaving me severely disturbed.
Wait. What are these records?

1186
01:32:38,167 --> 01:32:40,416
Don't look over there.
Those are my daughter's records.

1187
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,791
She had a DJ phase in college.

1188
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:47,291
Now this looks like something
a lady can properly dance to.

1189
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:50,542
Oh, come on.
That's not what I brought you in here for.

1190
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:57,000
You said you wanted to win me over.

1191
01:32:57,583 --> 01:32:58,791

Nothing is going to happen to Ruth.

Don't say that. We have to--

1265
01:36:07,292 --> 01:36:10,375
Ahh!

1266
01:36:41,833 --> 01:36:43,083
Is he okay?

1267
01:36:44,708 --> 01:36:46,166
Mm.

1268
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:48,375
He's a little warm,
but I think he'll be fine.

1269
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:52,708
What are you still doing up?

1270
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:58,375
I keep thinking about
this one <i>West Wing</i> episode.

1271
01:36:59,042 --> 01:37:01,124
There's this story,
someone tells the president--

1272
01:37:01,208 --> 01:37:03,125
You watched <i>The West Wing?</i>

1273
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:05,917
Only the Aaron Sorkin seasons.

1274
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:12,499
Anyway, the story was about a man
who lived by the river.

1275
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:15,749
And he hears on the radio
that the river is going to flood the town

1276
01:37:15,833 --> 01:37:17,458
and everyone should leave.

1277
01:37:17,542 --> 01:37:22,124
But the man doesn't go anywhere
because he prays every day.

1278
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:24,500
He knows that God loves him
and will save him.

1279
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:27,208
But then the flood actually happens.

1280
01:37:27,292 --> 01:37:29,999
And this guy in a rowboat sees the man

1281
01:37:30,083 --> 01:37:32,916
and says, "Hey, come on, I can save you."

1282
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,042
But the man tells him
he isn't going anywhere.

1283
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:39,833
Then the helicopter comes flying by,
and the pilot lowers the ladder,

1284
01:37:39,917 --> 01:37:42,292
but the man tells him
he isn't going anywhere.

1285
01:37:43,042 --> 01:37:45,541
After that, the man drowns in the flood.

1286
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:49,417
And so he goes up to heaven
and he's really angry at God,

1287
01:37:50,208 --> 01:37:52,833
and he tells him,
"I prayed to you every day.

1288
01:37:52,917 --> 01:37:55,667
I thought you loved me.
Why didn't you save me?"

1289
01:37:56,292 --> 01:37:57,791
And God says,

1290
01:37:57,875 --> 01:37:59,625
"I sent you a radio report,

1291
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,624
a rowboat and a helicopter.

1292
01:38:02,708 --> 01:38:04,667
What more do you want?"

1293
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,042
What's this about, Rose?

1294
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:17,958
I think I'm done waiting.

1295
01:38:51,042 --> 01:38:52,374
- Dad?
- Hmm?

1296
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:54,167
Will you sleep in the bed with me?

1297
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,750
Not sure.

1298
01:38:57,625 --> 01:39:00,583
The bed's not big,
and I don't mind sleeping on the floor.

1299
01:39:00,667 --> 01:39:03,000
- It's sometimes good for my back.
- I'm scared.

1300
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:10,750
It's just us now, isn't it?

1301
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,083
What do you mean by that?

1302
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:18,000
What I mean is,

1303
01:39:18,667 --> 01:39:19,791
if the shit goes down,

1304
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:22,583
do you trust these people
that are in our house?

1305
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,666
We already know the wife has no chill.

1306
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:28,458
That boy was sneaking
pictures of me by the pool.

1307
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:31,458
That little girl keeps staring
into the woods like Donnie Darko,

1308
01:39:31,542 --> 01:39:33,875
and I'm pretty sure
the husband wants to fuck me.

1309
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:37,000
How do you know that?

1310
01:39:38,042 --> 01:39:40,041
He's not actually going to do anything,
he's not "that guy."

1311
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:42,583
But did he want to? Abso-fucking-lutely.

1312
01:39:43,667 --> 01:39:46,000
My point remains, I don't trust them.

1313
01:39:57,625 --> 01:40:01,125
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you,
if that's what you're asking.

1314
01:40:03,042 --> 01:40:07,208
I'm asking for you to remember
that if the world falls apart,

1315
01:40:07,292 --> 01:40:10,041
trust should not be doled out easily to anyone,

1316
01:40:10,125 --> 01:40:11,875
especially white people.

1317
01:40:12,583 --> 01:40:14,542
Even mom would agree with me on that.

1318
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:19,125
I got it.

1319
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,583
Do you?

1320
01:40:23,708 --> 01:40:25,833
Because we're sleeping
in the basement of our own house

1321
01:40:25,917 --> 01:40:27,458
for the second night in a row.

1322
01:40:28,958 --> 01:40:32,375
Just what exactly was the point
of letting them back into the house?

1323
01:40:34,167 --> 01:40:35,708
It was the right thing to do.

1324
01:40:37,625 --> 01:40:41,208
And that right there.
That's what's going to fuck us in the end.

1325
01:41:17,833 --> 01:41:18,750
Drink up.

1326
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:30,624
Where's Rosie?

1327
01:41:30,708 --> 01:41:33,000
I don't know. She got up before us.

1328
01:41:35,417 --> 01:41:37,833
I'm gonna have a look around.
You should get up.

1329
01:41:45,625 --> 01:41:47,042
How are you feeling, baby?

1330
01:41:48,292 --> 01:41:49,125
Come on.

1331
01:41:50,042 --> 01:41:51,666
I know you're sleepy
but I need you to get up

1332
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:54,374
so I can get a look at you
and take your temperature.

1333
01:41:54,458 --> 01:41:56,083
You were pretty warm last night.

1334
01:41:57,750 --> 01:41:59,417
Well, you're not so warm now.

1335
01:42:00,208 --> 01:42:01,375
Yay.

1336
01:42:01,917 --> 01:42:03,208
Does your throat hurt?

1337
01:42:04,042 --> 01:42:05,542
- No.
- Good.

1338
01:42:14,417 --> 01:42:17,125
What is that? Blood, is that blood?

1339
01:42:21,917 --> 01:42:22,750
What are you--

1340
01:42:24,167 --> 01:42:25,000
What are you--

1341
01:42:25,708 --> 01:42:27,083
What are you fucking doing?

1342
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,125
What the fuck?
Are those your teeth?

1343
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:38,833
Archie.

1344
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:43,542
Stop doing that. Clay!

1345
01:42:50,417 --> 01:42:51,292
My teeth.

1346
01:42:51,917 --> 01:42:52,749
Clay!

1347
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:54,041
What's happening to me?

1348
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:54,958
Clay!

1349
01:42:55,042 --> 01:42:56,125
Is everything okay?

1350
01:42:56,667 --> 01:42:59,374
- Something's wrong with Archie.
- What is it? What the fuck?

1351
01:42:59,458 --> 01:43:02,666
- That's exactly what I said.
- My teeth just, they felt weird.

1352
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:04,583
And I touched them,
and they just they fell out.

1353
01:43:04,667 --> 01:43:06,749
He was a little warm last night
but this, I don't know.

1354
01:43:06,833 --> 01:43:09,541
Okay, all right.
Well you-- you're okay.

1355
01:43:09,625 --> 01:43:11,042
I don't feel okay.

1356
01:43:18,625 --> 01:43:19,542
How are you feeling?

1357
01:43:22,542 --> 01:43:24,666
Besides your teeth falling out, I mean.

1358
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:26,791
What kind of question is that?
He's obviously sick.

1359
01:43:26,875 --> 01:43:30,417
I'm not sick, Mom. My teeth just fell out.

1360
01:43:32,167 --> 01:43:33,749
Maybe it was the bug that bit me.
I don't know.

1361
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:34,667
What bug?

1362
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:37,916
A bug bit me yesterday in the woods.

1363
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,249
That must be it, then.

1364
01:43:39,333 --> 01:43:43,416
Probably just a tick, Lyme disease.
I've seen stranger symptoms.

1365
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:44,833
Stranger than this?

1366
01:43:44,917 --> 01:43:46,208
He needs to go to the emergency room.

1367
01:43:46,292 --> 01:43:47,458
We need to go to the hospital.

1368
01:43:47,542 --> 01:43:50,624
We can't. The expressway's
the only way out of town.

1369
01:43:50,708 --> 01:43:53,458
Besides, if the roads are jammed,
no one would be there to help us anyway.

1370
01:43:53,542 --> 01:43:56,750
Well, we have to do something.
Archie needs to see a doctor.

1371
01:43:57,333 --> 01:43:59,458
I can't believe this is happening.

1372
01:43:59,542 --> 01:44:01,625
I can't believe this is happening.

1373
01:44:05,083 --> 01:44:08,041
We'll go to my contractor's house.
He's not that far from here.

1374
01:44:08,125 --> 01:44:10,958
You said you saw him
stocking up on supplies?

1375
01:44:11,042 --> 01:44:12,833
If I know Danny,
he's prepared for anything.

1376
01:44:12,917 --> 01:44:14,166
He might have something useful.

1377
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:15,917
Antibiotics, medicine.

1378
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:17,875
Danny'll know what to do.

1379
01:44:19,125 --> 01:44:19,958
Hey.

1380
01:44:20,708 --> 01:44:23,541
I promise you,
I'll get your son some help.

1381
01:44:25,333 --> 01:44:26,167
Where's Rose?

1382
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:29,458
I couldn't find her.

1383
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:32,166
What? What does that mean?

1384
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:34,291
I looked all over the house.
She's not here.

1385
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:36,458
- She's not in the backyard.
- I'll look downstairs.

1386
01:44:36,542 --> 01:44:38,124
She's probably exploring the house.

1387
01:44:38,208 --> 01:44:40,124
She might be playing outside.
I'll look out for her.

1388
01:44:40,208 --> 01:44:41,749
I looked there
but feel free to check again.

1389
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:42,999
I don't understand.
Where is she?

1390
01:44:43,083 --> 01:44:44,958
- She has to be here somewhere.
- No, she's not!

1391
01:44:45,042 --> 01:44:48,208
I'm telling you, I have
looked everywhere and she's not here.

1392
01:44:48,292 --> 01:44:51,624
- Well, she should be in the garage.
- I already looked in the garage.

1393
01:44:51,708 --> 01:44:53,750
Okay. Where the fuck
haven't you looked, Clay?

1394
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:56,583
She's not down there.

1395
01:44:56,667 --> 01:44:58,583
Okay, this is insane. Where is she?

1396
01:44:58,667 --> 01:44:59,666
She wasn't outside,

1397
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:02,124
but I think she may have taken
one of the bikes from the garage.

1398
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:03,916
Took one of the bikes?
Where would she go?

1399
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,875
Do you have any idea
where your sister might be, bud?

1400
01:45:06,458 --> 01:45:07,416
I don't know.

1401
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:10,208
Um, we were out
by the shed yesterday, so--

1402
01:45:10,292 --> 01:45:11,541
The shed? What shed?

1403
01:45:11,625 --> 01:45:12,999
The-- the shed.

1404
01:45:13,083 --> 01:45:16,041
Um, she-- she saw some deer
and she wanted to go look for them.

1405
01:45:16,125 --> 01:45:18,875
- So maybe there. I don't know.
- Okay, I'm going.

1406
01:45:21,708 --> 01:45:24,124
Archie, you all right?

1407
01:45:24,208 --> 01:45:26,666
Are you all right--

1408
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:28,541
- He needs help now.
- Yeah, okay.

1409
01:45:28,625 --> 01:45:30,583
- Okay, I got you.
- I'm coming with you.

1410
01:45:30,667 --> 01:45:31,999
No, it's not safe.

1411
01:45:32,083 --> 01:45:34,041
Stay here with Amanda. Find Rose.

1412
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:36,291
No. What?
You can't leave me here by myself.

1413
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:38,124
- It'll be okay.
- Dad, we talked about this.

1414
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:39,791
You cannot leave me here by myself.

1415
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:42,958
- He's sick, don't you see that?
- Dad, you will never come back.

1416
01:45:43,042 --> 01:45:44,999
Don't you see that something is happening?

1417
01:45:45,083 --> 01:45:46,333
It is happening right now.

1418
01:45:46,417 --> 01:45:49,291
Whatever it is, it's happening to Archie,
it's happening to all of us.

1419
01:45:49,375 --> 01:45:51,916
You can't leave.
The world could be ending out there.

1420
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,375
That's why I want you here.

1421
01:45:54,458 --> 01:45:55,542
Take out your phone.

1422
01:45:56,792 --> 01:45:58,374
Come on, take it out.

1423
01:45:58,458 --> 01:45:59,833
Set a timer, one hour.

1424
01:46:00,667 --> 01:46:01,583
I'll be back.

1425
01:46:02,833 --> 01:46:03,833
It won't work.

1426
01:46:04,458 --> 01:46:05,499
It won't work out.

1427
01:46:05,583 --> 01:46:07,208
It will, there's no choice.

1428
01:46:07,292 --> 01:46:09,958
Look, I'll be back for you
before this goes off.

1429
01:46:19,542 --> 01:46:22,708
One hour.
That's what you get. You've promised.

1430
01:46:32,167 --> 01:46:35,833
Rose? Rose!

1431
01:46:35,917 --> 01:46:40,041
Rosie! Rose!

1432
01:46:57,542 --> 01:46:59,500
This is a nightmare.

1433
01:47:00,083 --> 01:47:01,750
This is a goddamn nightmare.

1434
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:06,750
Where would Rose have gone?
Why would she leave?

1435
01:47:07,333 --> 01:47:09,875
She said she was done waiting.
What did she mean?

1436
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:15,833
What if we just went back to the house
and we waited for my dad to get back?

1437
01:47:16,417 --> 01:47:17,417
And then what?

1438
01:47:18,167 --> 01:47:19,624
He'll find Rose?

1439
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:21,792
I don't know, but he will help us.

1440
01:47:22,375 --> 01:47:24,708
I just want to know
what the fuck is happening.

1441
01:47:24,792 --> 01:47:26,541
I want to know what the fuck is the plan.

1442
01:47:26,625 --> 01:47:30,749
I want to know that we can find my kid
and then get in your fucking expensive car

1443
01:47:30,833 --> 01:47:33,749
and drive to an actual hospital,
find a doctor who will tell me

1444
01:47:33,833 --> 01:47:36,583
that my baby is okay,
that we're all gonna be okay,

1445
01:47:36,667 --> 01:47:38,749
and then we can just
all go back to our house.

1446
01:47:38,833 --> 01:47:40,124
What if that's not possible?

1447
01:47:40,208 --> 01:47:44,708
I want to get the fuck away from here,
and you, and whatever is happening.

1448
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:46,124
It's happening to all of us.

1449
01:47:46,208 --> 01:47:48,166
I know that it is happening to all of us!

1450
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:49,708
Stop yelling at me!

1451
01:47:59,667 --> 01:48:00,667
You don't care.

1452
01:48:03,417 --> 01:48:04,875
You don't care that I'm here.

1453
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:10,250
And my mom is probably
at the bottom of some ocean.

1454
01:48:14,417 --> 01:48:17,208
I don't have anyone else in my life.

1455
01:48:18,375 --> 01:48:22,875
I have nothing to go home to but them.
Do you understand that?

1456
01:48:24,833 --> 01:48:28,042
And I need my mom more than ever.

1457
01:48:30,042 --> 01:48:32,333
And I will probably never see her again.

1458
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,167
I care, I do.

1459
01:48:47,125 --> 01:48:50,250
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do about that, but I do care.

1460
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,875
Why are you like this?

1461
01:48:58,417 --> 01:49:01,792
What do you get
out of being so angry all the time?

1462
01:49:13,417 --> 01:49:18,083
Every day, all day, my job--
my whole job is to...

1463
01:49:19,042 --> 01:49:22,916
...understand people well enough
so that I know how to lie to them,

1464
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,750
so I can sell them things
they don't really want.

1465
01:49:26,625 --> 01:49:28,708
And when you study people like that,

1466
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:32,458
when you really see the way
they treat each other, well...

1467
01:49:33,875 --> 01:49:34,792
You're no dummy.

1468
01:49:35,917 --> 01:49:39,916
You see what they do, and they do it
without even thinking about it.

1469
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Fuck. I did it to you and your dad,
and I don't even really know why.

1470
01:49:45,333 --> 01:49:47,624
We fuck each other over

1471
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:50,374
all the time, without even realizing it.

1472
01:49:50,458 --> 01:49:55,083
We fuck every living thing on this planet
over and think it'll be fine

1473
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:59,667
because we use paper straws and order the free range chicken.

1474
01:50:00,625 --> 01:50:05,249
And the sick thing is, I think deep down we know we're not fooling anyone.

1475
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:07,291
I think we know we're living a lie.

1476
01:50:07,375 --> 01:50:09,874
An agreed upon mass delusion

1477
01:50:09,958 --> 01:50:13,667
to help us ignore and keep ignoring how awful we really are.

1478
01:50:21,417 --> 01:50:25,250
I'm not down with most of the things that you do and say, but...

1479
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:30,375
...this is the part of the Venn diagram
where we overlap.

1480
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,500
I agree with everything you just said.

1481
01:50:36,417 --> 01:50:41,000
But as awful as people might be...

1482
01:50:43,375 --> 01:50:46,375
...nothing's gonna change the fact
that we are all we've got.

1483
01:50:51,125 --> 01:50:52,708
I don't want to be this way.

1484
01:51:00,542 --> 01:51:02,375
I hate being terrible like this.

1485
01:51:04,667 --> 01:51:07,333
And I know I say I hate people, but I...

1486
01:51:07,417 --> 01:51:09,958
I'd do anything to have them back.

1487
01:52:12,042 --> 01:52:13,292
Hey, Dad.

1488
01:52:13,875 --> 01:52:15,875
Do you think Taylor's okay?

1489
01:52:16,708 --> 01:52:17,542
Who?

1490
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:24,875
Archie, you stay here.

1491
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:27,416
Let's go.

1492
01:52:45,208 --> 01:52:46,167
George.

1493
01:52:46,750 --> 01:52:50,124
Danny. Sorry to bother you
at home like this.

1494
01:52:50,208 --> 01:52:52,499
I'm gonna need you and your comrade
to step off the porch

1495
01:52:52,583 --> 01:52:53,917
and stand by your vehicle.

1496
01:52:55,292 --> 01:52:56,374
What?

1497
01:52:56,458 --> 01:52:58,833
Off the porch and by your vehicle.

1498
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:22,000
What can I do for you?

1499
01:53:27,333 --> 01:53:28,792
We're just checking on you.

1500
01:53:30,042 --> 01:53:32,167
Seeing if you're here, if you're okay.

1501
01:53:33,542 --> 01:53:36,124
If you heard anything
about what's going on.

1502
01:53:36,208 --> 01:53:37,624
Yeah, I'm Clay.

1503
01:53:37,708 --> 01:53:41,166
My family rented G.H.'s--
George's home, you know.

1504
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:42,708
We're from the city.

1505
01:53:42,792 --> 01:53:44,958
Well, that's a lucky break
for your family.

1506
01:53:45,042 --> 01:53:47,542
Imagine what a shit show
the city must be right now.

1507
01:53:48,583 --> 01:53:51,542
I got to be honest with you,
I'm surprised you guys are even out.

1508
01:53:52,417 --> 01:53:54,958
We came out here
because my son needs help.

1509
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:58,041
He's vomiting. He's--

1510
01:53:58,125 --> 01:54:01,124
He's lost his teeth.
They just fell out. Can't explain it.

1511
01:54:01,208 --> 01:54:03,167
Oh. His teeth, huh?

1512
01:54:04,458 --> 01:54:07,042
Well, it's gotta have something
to do with that noise.

1513
01:54:10,125 --> 01:54:11,874
You know something about the noise?

1514
01:54:11,958 --> 01:54:16,708
Well, it's not all that dissimilar
to what happened in Cuba a while back.

1515
01:54:16,792 --> 01:54:19,666
Microwave weapons, they call it,
produces a kind of radiation

1516
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:21,958
that can be beamed out through sound.

1517
01:54:22,833 --> 01:54:25,791
Some people lost their teeth there too.

1518
01:54:25,875 --> 01:54:28,124
Outside of that,
the only thing I know for sure is

1519
01:54:28,208 --> 01:54:30,625
there's not a lot of information
getting out, so...

1520
01:54:32,417 --> 01:54:33,625
I assume it's a war.

1521
01:54:35,542 --> 01:54:37,166
The beginning of one, anyways.

1522
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:38,958
They've been saying there was chatter.

1523
01:54:39,042 --> 01:54:41,249
This has to be
what they were chattering about.

1524
01:54:41,333 --> 01:54:43,667
Chatter, what do you mean, "chatter"?

1525
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:47,917
You got to read the papers
deeper than page one.

1526
01:54:48,708 --> 01:54:52,124
The Russians recalled
their staff from Washington.

1527
01:54:52,208 --> 01:54:53,791
Did you even notice that?

1528
01:54:53,875 --> 01:54:56,958
Something is afoot.
Now, what that is exactly, I don't know.

1529
01:54:57,042 --> 01:54:59,041
Maybe this is as much
as we're ever going to know.

1530
01:54:59,125 --> 01:55:03,042
Maybe we just need to sit tight, be safe.

1531
01:55:04,542 --> 01:55:06,500
Pray. Whatever works for you.

1532
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:10,583
Well, Danny.

1533
01:55:12,333 --> 01:55:14,375
It's like Clay said, his son isn't well.

1534
01:55:15,458 --> 01:55:17,708
We're gonna need more than just prayers.

1535
01:55:17,792 --> 01:55:20,083
And knowing how primed you are for these kind of situations,

1536
01:55:20,167 --> 01:55:22,541
we're thinking you might have
some medicine that'd be able to help him.

1537
01:55:22,625 --> 01:55:24,875
What I got isn't your business.

1538
01:55:28,583 --> 01:55:29,458
Danny.

1539
01:55:30,042 --> 01:55:32,167
Come on now, it's me.
We know each other.

1540
01:55:33,375 --> 01:55:34,374
We're friends.

1541
01:55:34,458 --> 01:55:38,541
That's the old way, George.
You're not thinking clearly.

1542
01:55:38,625 --> 01:55:40,416
Danny, what are you saying?

1543
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:42,791
You're telling this man
not to take care of his son?

1544
01:55:42,875 --> 01:55:44,374
Nothing makes a whole lot of sense right now.

1545
01:55:44,458 --> 01:55:47,541
When the world doesn't make any sense,
I can still do what's rational,

1546
01:55:47,625 --> 01:55:49,250
which is protect my own.

1547
01:55:50,125 --> 01:55:52,958
What you do is your business.

1548
01:55:53,042 --> 01:55:56,166
I thought I was doing the right thing
by bringing them here.

1549
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:58,416
Now if you have some medicine
that can help him--

1550
01:55:58,500 --> 01:55:59,999
We can pay.

1551
01:56:00,083 --> 01:56:02,458
Um, a-- a--

1552
01:56:02,542 --> 01:56:04,791
Say, a thousand dollars?

1553
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:07,374
Cash might not mean much
if the government falls.

1554
01:56:07,458 --> 01:56:10,833
Well, the whole network's down.
My credit cards aren't going to work.

1555
01:56:10,917 --> 01:56:13,624
There's no Venmo or ApplePay.

1556
01:56:13,708 --> 01:56:16,917
I mean, cash might be the only thing
that means something.

1557
01:56:19,042 --> 01:56:22,458
My son's really sick.
He needs your help. He's 16 years old.

1558
01:56:30,833 --> 01:56:32,000
Nothing's here.

1559
01:56:50,125 --> 01:56:51,125
Rosie.

1560
01:56:54,625 --> 01:56:56,833
You're in a difficult position.

1561
01:56:56,917 --> 01:56:58,042
I get it.

1562
01:56:58,625 --> 01:57:01,083
I would do anything I had to
for my family.

1563
01:57:01,167 --> 01:57:02,583
So that's what I'm doing.

1564
01:57:02,667 --> 01:57:05,458
I'm locking the doors.
I'm waiting, I'm watching,

1565
01:57:05,542 --> 01:57:07,499
I'm getting out my gun.

1566
01:57:07,583 --> 01:57:10,458
Other than that,
I don't have any answers for you.

1567
01:57:14,083 --> 01:57:15,708
Ruth, it's bike tracks--

1568
01:57:22,417 --> 01:57:25,333
I'm going to go back inside my house now.

1569
01:57:25,417 --> 01:57:28,333
I'm gonna say goodbye and good luck.

1570
01:57:28,417 --> 01:57:30,458
You come out again,
you're welcome to stop by,

1571
01:57:30,542 --> 01:57:33,292
but I can't offer you
much more than conversation.

1572
01:57:34,292 --> 01:57:37,083
I suggest you try
your neighbors, the Thornes.

1573
01:57:37,167 --> 01:57:38,833
They did a basement conversion on the down-low a while back,

1574
01:57:38,917 --> 01:57:41,333
on the down-low a while back,
no permits or nothing.

1575
01:57:41,417 --> 01:57:43,958
A buddy of mine worked on it.
He wouldn't even show me the plans.

1576
01:57:44,042 --> 01:57:45,416
Now, you ask me?

1577
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:48,583
That's rich asshole talk for doomsday bunker.

1578
01:57:48,667 --> 01:57:51,083
Come on, Danny.
You can't desert us like this.

1579
01:57:53,333 --> 01:57:57,833
Haven't you been picking up on what's going on out there, George?

1580
01:57:58,417 --> 01:58:00,083
We've all been deserted.

1581
01:58:30,042 --> 01:58:31,458
<i>All due respect.</i>

1582
01:58:32,542 --> 01:58:35,167
I would like all of you
off of my property.

1583
01:58:36,458 --> 01:58:37,458
Now.

1584
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:54,042
We're not going anywhere
till you give us what we need.

1585
01:59:10,667 --> 01:59:12,958
What the fuck is going on right now?

1586
01:59:17,542 --> 01:59:19,666
I promised this boy's mother
I'd get him some help.

1587
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:21,833
The only thing you're helping him to is a quick death unless you lower your weapons.

1588
01:59:21,917 --> 01:59:24,499
- unless you lower your weapons.
- G.H., put the gun down.

1589
01:59:24,583 --> 01:59:27,208
- We'll find another way to the hospital.
- There is no other way!

1590
01:59:27,292 --> 01:59:28,624
Besides, he's not gonna shoot us.

1591
01:59:28,708 --> 01:59:30,833
Uh... It sounds like he's gonna shoot us.

1592
01:59:30,917 --> 01:59:32,916
- I'm telling you he's bluffing.
- The fuck I am.

1593
01:59:41,417 --> 01:59:43,041
Hold-- Hold on!
Hold on!

1594
01:59:43,125 --> 01:59:44,499
- Clay, get out of the way!
- Dad!

1595
01:59:44,583 --> 01:59:46,166
I'm trying to reason with him!

1596
01:59:53,625 --> 01:59:55,333
The only way this ends

1597
01:59:55,417 --> 01:59:58,083
is if you get back in your vehicle
and drive away now.

1598
01:59:58,167 --> 02:00:01,041
Drive away to what?
All the roads are blocked.

1599
02:00:01,125 --> 02:00:03,583
We're in the middle of God-knows-where.
There's no one else around.

1600
02:00:03,667 --> 02:00:06,833
I have no idea
what I am supposed to do right now.

1601
02:00:06,917 --> 02:00:10,833
I can barely do anything
without my cell phone and my GPS.

1602
02:00:10,917 --> 02:00:13,542
I am a useless man.

1603
02:00:14,792 --> 02:00:16,833
But my son is sick.

1604
02:00:17,917 --> 02:00:20,667
And my daughter is missing.

1605
02:00:21,833 --> 02:00:23,583
And I don't know what to do.

1606
02:00:24,917 --> 02:00:28,541
But you are a very prepared man.

1607
02:00:28,625 --> 02:00:29,749
Fuck yeah, I am.

1608
02:00:29,833 --> 02:00:31,416
That's right, that's why we came to you,

1609
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:33,416
because you're the only one
who can help my son.

1610
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:36,416
- Not my problem.
- No, you're right. It's not.

1611
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:39,708
But it's like you said, right?

1612
02:00:39,792 --> 02:00:43,041
What would you do if it was your family?
That's what I'm doing.

1613
02:00:43,125 --> 02:00:44,875
It's the only thing I can do.

1614
02:00:45,458 --> 02:00:47,333
I am begging you.

1615
02:00:47,417 --> 02:00:48,333
Please.

1616
02:00:49,458 --> 02:00:51,375
Please help my son.

1617
02:01:33,375 --> 02:01:37,500
I guess an old fashioned barter system
was to be expected at some point.

1618
02:01:38,583 --> 02:01:41,291
It's still cash,
so it's not really a barter system.

1619
02:01:41,375 --> 02:01:43,791
Hey, I got another tidbit for you.

1620
02:01:43,875 --> 02:01:45,583
Free of charge, if you want it.

1621
02:01:47,833 --> 02:01:49,958
It's the Koreans behind all this.

1622
02:01:51,042 --> 02:01:51,958
Koreans?

1623
02:01:55,792 --> 02:01:57,166
What makes you say that?

1624
02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:59,624
Just trust me. It's the Koreans.

1625
02:01:59,708 --> 02:02:01,375
Or the Chinese. One of them.

1626
02:02:05,208 --> 02:02:06,500
Show him.

1627
02:02:10,208 --> 02:02:12,499
I was driving around yesterday.

1628
02:02:12,583 --> 02:02:15,583
There's a big drone
dropping these everywhere.

1629
02:02:15,667 --> 02:02:20,833
It means "Death to America,"
so we're thinking Iranians.

1630
02:02:21,875 --> 02:02:25,667
I remember hearing something on NPR once
about their cyber capabilities.

1631
02:02:29,333 --> 02:02:30,250
Why is that funny?

1632
02:02:32,917 --> 02:02:35,208
Before the phones went out,

1633
02:02:35,292 --> 02:02:39,166
I heard from a friend of mine in San Diego
about a similar event,

1634
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:42,999
drones dropping pamphlets
except they were in Korean.

1635
02:02:43,083 --> 02:02:46,208
Or Mandarin.
Like I said, he couldn't tell which.

1636
02:02:46,292 --> 02:02:49,874
But seeing as he did four tours in Iraq,

1637
02:02:49,958 --> 02:02:52,583
he sure as shit would have known if it looked like that.

1638
02:02:58,417 --> 02:03:01,291
We made a lot of enemies around the world.

1639
02:03:01,375 --> 02:03:03,958
Maybe all this means
is a few of them teamed up.

1640
02:03:12,542 --> 02:03:14,500
I saw flamingos in our pool last night.

1641
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:19,708
The animals, they're trying to warn us.

1642
02:03:22,208 --> 02:03:23,583
They know something.

1643
02:03:24,875 --> 02:03:27,124
They know something that we don't.

1644
02:03:27,208 --> 02:03:29,667
It's like when dogs know
storms are coming.

1645
02:03:31,708 --> 02:03:33,500
There's more bike tracks up ahead.

1646
02:03:40,125 --> 02:03:43,374
We should go back to the house.
My dad is probably there.

1647
02:03:43,458 --> 02:03:45,750
Maybe he can help... us.

1648
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:50,625
I'm not going anywhere without Rosie.

1649
02:03:56,250 --> 02:03:59,292
That house.
That's gotta be where she went.

1650
02:04:01,708 --> 02:04:03,999
All right, let's go back
and see if they found Rose.

1651
02:04:19,375 --> 02:04:22,167
G.H., what's going on?

1652
02:04:24,917 --> 02:04:26,042
Before we go...

1653
02:04:28,792 --> 02:04:31,042
I need to know that you're on the level with me.

1654
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:37,124
No matter how far this thing goes,
I need to know that we're good

1655
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:39,749
because if what just happened here
is happening everywhere,

1656
02:04:39,833 --> 02:04:41,999
we need to get to that bunker
Danny told us about,

1657
02:04:42,083 --> 02:04:44,249
and we need to get there now.

1658
02:04:44,333 --> 02:04:45,875
What are you talking about?

1659
02:04:50,333 --> 02:04:51,458
You know something.

1660
02:04:56,833 --> 02:05:00,000
I had a sneaking suspicion, but I wanted more information first.

1661
02:05:00,958 --> 02:05:03,000
All signs were there, sure, but I...

1662
02:05:04,167 --> 02:05:06,458
I didn't want to scare anyone.

1663
02:05:06,542 --> 02:05:08,791
You'd have called me crazy
because it is crazy.

1664
02:05:08,875 --> 02:05:11,708
It would have made more sense if we were
on the brink of an all-out invasion,

1665
02:05:11,792 --> 02:05:12,917
but this...

1666
02:05:15,375 --> 02:05:17,374
I didn't think we'd actually let
something like this happen.

1667
02:05:17,458 --> 02:05:18,791
I thought we were smarter than that.

1668
02:05:18,875 --> 02:05:20,000
Let what happen?

1669
02:05:24,292 --> 02:05:26,541
Because my primary client
works in the defense sector,

1670
02:05:26,625 --> 02:05:30,792
I spend a lot of time studying the cost
benefit analysis of military campaigns.

1671
02:05:31,708 --> 02:05:35,250
There was one program in particular
that terrified my client the most.

1672
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,083
A simple three-stage maneuver that could
topple a country's government from within.

1673
02:05:43,125 --> 02:05:46,249
The first stage is isolation.

1674
02:05:46,333 --> 02:05:48,917
<i>Disable their communication
and transportation.</i>

1675
02:05:49,917 --> 02:05:53,291
<i>Make the target as deaf, dumb
and paralyzed as possible,</i>

1676
02:05:53,375 --> 02:05:55,458
<i>setting them up for the second stage.</i>

1677
02:05:56,042 --> 02:05:58,041
Synchronized chaos.

1678
02:05:58,125 --> 02:06:02,041
<i>Terrorize them with covert attacks and misinformation,</i>

1679
02:06:02,125 --> 02:06:03,958
<i>overwhelming their defense capabilities</i>

1680
02:06:04,042 --> 02:06:08,124
<i>leaving their weapon systems vulnerable
to extremists and their own military.</i>

1681
02:06:08,208 --> 02:06:12,292
<i>Without a clear enemy or motive,
people would start turning on each other.</i>

1682
02:06:15,417 --> 02:06:19,375
If done successfully,
the third stage would happen on its own.

1683
02:06:21,625 --> 02:06:23,042
What's the third stage?

1684
02:06:27,833 --> 02:06:28,833
Coup d'état.

1685
02:06:31,542 --> 02:06:32,542
Civil war.

1686
02:06:36,542 --> 02:06:37,458
Collapse.

1687
02:06:43,542 --> 02:06:46,124
This program was considered
the most cost-effective way

1688
02:06:46,208 --> 02:06:47,958
to destabilize a country.

1689
02:06:49,167 --> 02:06:52,083
Because if the target nation
was dysfunctional enough,

1690
02:06:52,167 --> 02:06:54,833
it would, in essence, do the work for you.

1691
02:07:01,208 --> 02:07:03,833
Whoever started this
wants us to finish it.

1692
02:09:31,917 --> 02:09:32,917
