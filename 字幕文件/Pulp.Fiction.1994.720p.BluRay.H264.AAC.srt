1
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,428
Forget it. It's too risky. I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:35,966
You always say that. The same thing every time.

3
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:37,977
"l'm through, never again, too dangerous." 

4
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:40,537
I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too.

5
00:00:40,617 --> 00:00:44,015
- You forget about it in a day or two. - The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:46,176
The days of me remembering have just begun.

7
00:00:46,248 --> 00:00:48,417
You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like ?

8
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:51,516
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man. - You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:55,046
- Quack, quack, quack. - Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:58,615
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:03,425
- After tonight ? - Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:06,335
- Can I get anyone more coffee ? - Oh, yes !

13
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:10,695
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

14
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:13,864
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:16,745
you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:18,874
Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.

17
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,973
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:26,284
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck ? I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.

19
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:29,814
Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:32,864
He gives the phone to a teller. The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:36,493
"We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."

22
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:39,364
- Did it work ? - Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:45,273
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone. Not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:49,974
- Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger. - Did they hurt the little girl ?

25
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:53,742
There probably never was a little girl. The point of the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,802
The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,852
- You want to rob banks ? - I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:02,353
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing.

29
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:06,582
-No more liquor stores ? -What've we been talkin' about ? Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:09,632
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be. There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

31
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:11,631
Vietnamese, Koreans, don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:14,062
You tell 'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:16,071
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:20,371
- We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him. - I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:24,741
I don't want to either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,741
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:29,441
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:33,950
You got Grandpa lrving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:35,951
Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,961
See how far that gets you. Forget it.

41
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:40,961
- We're out of it. - Well, what then, day jobs ?

42
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:43,050
- Not in this life. - What then ?

43
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,429
GarÃ§on, coffee !

44
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,800
This place.

45
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,359
GarÃ§on means boy.

46
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,269
This place ? A coffee shop ?

47
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,309
What's wrong with that ?

48
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,037
Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not ?

49
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,448
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,248
gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,988
Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:21,757
They're not expectin' to get robbed. Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:26,327
- I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this. - Correct.

54
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:29,666
Same as banks, these places are insured.

55
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:32,107
Manager. He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:35,008
They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:39,036
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way they're takin' a bullet for the register.

58
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:42,046
Busboys. Some wetback gettin' paid $1.50 an hour...

59
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:44,646
really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner ?

60
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:47,816
Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

61
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:52,556
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:57,686
See, I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up, remember ?

63
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:00,465
- All the customers kept comin' in. - Yeah.

64
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:04,364
You got the idea of takin' their wallets. Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:07,835
- Thank you. - Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.

66
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:10,206
- Yes, we did. - A lot of people come to restaurants.

67
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:13,934
- A lot of wallets. - Pretty smart, huh ?

68
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:16,035
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:17,585 --> 00:04:20,613
I'm ready. Let's do it. Right now, right here.

70
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:25,185
- Come on. - All right. Same as last time, remember ?

71
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:28,025
You're crowd control. I'll handle the employees.

72
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:36,373
- I love you, Pumpkin. - I love you, Honey Bunny.

73
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:40,073
Everybody be cool ! This is a robbery !

74
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:43,014
Any of you fucking pricks move, and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.

75
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:46,983
and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.

76
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:47,313
and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.

77
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:40,726
-  Jungle boogie -  Get down with the boogie

78
00:06:40,797 --> 00:06:42,956
-  Jungle boogie -  Get it on

79
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,227
-  Jungle boogie -  Get down with the boogie

80
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:47,527
-  Jungle boogie -  Get it on

81
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:49,867
-  Jungle boogie -  Get up with the boogie

82
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:51,996
-  Jungle boogie -  Get up with the get down

83
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:54,366
-  Jungle boogie -  Get down and boogie

84
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:57,605
-  Jungle boogie -  Shake it around

85
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:08,464
- Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars. - Okay, what you want to know ?

86
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:11,375
- Hash is legal there, right ? - It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

87
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:16,075
You just can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffin' away.

88
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:19,473
I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places.

89
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:22,215
- Those are hash bars ? - Yeah. It breaks down like this.

90
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:24,614
It's legal to buy it. It's legal to own it.

91
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:27,883
And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

92
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:32,353
It's illegal to carry it, but-but that doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.

93
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:36,883
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you.

94
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:40,903
- I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have. - Oh, man ! I'm goin'.

95
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:43,493
That's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.

96
00:07:43,574 --> 00:07:46,503
I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.

97
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:49,303
- But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is ? - What ?

98
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:53,311
It's the little differences. I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here,

99
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:56,941
- but it's just there, it's a little different. - Example.

100
00:07:57,014 --> 00:08:00,142
You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

101
00:08:00,224 --> 00:08:03,852
And I don't mean just like no paper cup. I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

102
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:07,751
And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's. You know what they call...

103
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:11,321
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in Paris ?

104
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:13,591
They don't call it a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese ?

105
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:16,462
They got the metric system. They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.

106
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:20,440
- What do they call it ? - They call it a Royale with Cheese.

107
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:21,971
- Royale with Cheese. - That's right.

108
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,971
What do they call a Big Mac ?

109
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:27,340
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.

110
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:30,539
Le Big Mac.

111
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:34,780
- What do they call a Whopper ? - I don't know. I didn't go into Burger King.

112
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:38,290
- You know what they put on French fries in Holland instead of ketchup ? - What ?

113
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:41,349
- Mayonnaise. - Goddamn !

114
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:45,729
- I seen 'em do it, man. They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit. - Yuck.

115
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:51,699
We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.

116
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,439
- How many up there ? - Three or four.

117
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,098
- That's countin' our guy ? - Not sure.

118
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:04,577
- So that means that it could be up to five guys up there ? - It's possible.

119
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,008
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

120
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,749
- What's her name ? - Mia.

121
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:14,017
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet ? - I don't know.

122
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:17,687
However people meet people. She used to be a actress.

123
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,247
Oh, really ? She do anything I'd have seen ?

124
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:24,767
- I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot. - Pilot ? What's a pilot ?

125
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,357
- Well, you know the shows on TV ? - I don't watch TV.

126
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:32,067
Yeah, but you are aware that there is an invention called television,

127
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,236
- and on this invention they show shows, right ? - Yeah.

128
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:39,716
The way they pick TV shows is they make one show. That show's called a pilot.

129
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:42,716
Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows...

130
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:45,717
and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they wanna make more shows.

131
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:50,316
Some get chosen and become television programs. Some don't, become nothin'.

132
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:53,585
She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

133
00:09:53,656 --> 00:09:56,425
You remember Antwan Rockamora ?

134
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:00,324
Half-black, half-Samoan. Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."

135
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:03,795
- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right ? - I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.

136
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:06,706
I mean, he got a weight problem. What's a nigger gonna do ? He's Samoan.

137
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:11,204
- I think I know who you mean. What about him ? - Marsellus fucked him up good.

138
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:15,503
Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

139
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:27,683
- So what he'd do ? Fuck her ? - No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

140
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:31,453
- Well, then what then ? - He gave her a foot massage.

141
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:35,963
A foot massage ?

142
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,094
- That's it ? - Mm-hmm.

143
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:40,103
Then what'd Marsellus do ?

144
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:43,333
Sent a couple cats over to his place. They took him out on his patio.

145
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:47,342
Threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories.

146
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,471
He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

147
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:53,812
Nigger fell through that.

148
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:56,823
Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment.

149
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:01,023
- That's a damn shame. - Hmm.

150
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:09,530
- But still, you play with matches, you get burned. - What do you mean ?

151
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:13,760
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

152
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:16,301
You don't think he overreacted ?

153
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:21,242
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.

154
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:25,470
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.

155
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:29,069
It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife.

156
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:34,051
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out ? No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.

157
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:36,211
Whoa, stop right there. Eatin' the bitch out...

158
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,880
and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing.

159
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:42,899
- It's not. It's the same ballpark. - Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

160
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:45,900
Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine.

161
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,728
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...

162
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,068
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

163
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,008
- Foot massages don't mean shit ! - Have you ever given a foot massage ?

164
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,168
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.

165
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:03,908
- I'm the foot fuckin' master. - You given a lot of them ?

166
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:08,217
Shit, yeah ! Got my technique down and everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

167
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:10,948
Would you give a guy a foot massage ?

168
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:15,058
- Fuck you.

169
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:18,217
- You give 'em a lot ? - Fuck you.

170
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,557
- You know, I'm kind of tired. I could use a foot massage. - Yo, yo, yo, man.

171
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:24,826
You best back off. I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

172
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:28,467
- This is the door. - Yeah, it is.

173
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:33,867
What time you got ?

174
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:36,066
7:22 in the a.m.

175
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:39,706
No, it ain't quite time yet. Come on. Let's hang back.

176
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:51,055
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right...

177
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:54,325
for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin' house,

178
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:57,126
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks; that shit ain't right.

179
00:12:57,196 --> 00:13:01,434
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.

180
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:06,465
I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a massage don't mean nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

181
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:11,175
Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.

182
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:14,974
We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

183
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,144
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

184
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:20,444
where you don't talk about it, but you know it and she knows it.

185
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:25,585
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan should've fuckin' better known better.

186
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:30,063
That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit.

187
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:32,924
You know what I'm sayin' ?

188
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:34,933
It's an interestin' point.

189
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:36,934
Come on. Let's get into character.

190
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:45,883
- What's her name again ? - Mia.

191
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:48,971
- Mia. - Why you so interested in big man's wife ?

192
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:54,282
He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.

193
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:58,311
- Take care of her ? - No, man. Just take her out.

194
00:13:58,393 --> 00:14:01,761
Show her a good time. Make sure she don't get lonely.

195
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,352
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date ?

196
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:07,061
It is not a date.

197
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:11,230
It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

198
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:14,831
- It's just good company, that's all.

199
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:23,611
- It's not a date. It's definitely not a date.

200
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:33,809
Hey, kids. How you boys doin' ?

201
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,550
Hey, keep chillin'.

202
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,519
You know who we are ?

203
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:49,549
We're associates of your business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

204
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:52,659
You do remember your business partner, don't you ?

205
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,309
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

206
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:03,367
- You're Brett, right ? - Yeah.

207
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,778
I thought so. You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace,

208
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,679
don't ya, Brett ?

209
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:11,408
Yeah, I remember.

210
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:15,817
Good. Looks like me and Vincent caught you boys at breakfast.

211
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:18,517
Sorry about that. Whatcha havin' ?

212
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:20,557
Hamburgers.

213
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,727
Hamburgers ! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

214
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:28,398
What kind of hamburgers ?

215
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:30,197
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers. - No, no, no.

216
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:33,366
Where'd you get 'em ? McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box ?

217
00:15:33,437 --> 00:15:36,236
- Where ? - Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

218
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:39,435
Big Kahuna Burger ! That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

219
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:43,446
I hear they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself. How are they ?

220
00:15:43,518 --> 00:15:46,217
They're-- They're good.

221
00:15:46,287 --> 00:15:48,916
You mind if I try one of yours ?

222
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:51,426
- This is yours here, right ? - Yeah.

223
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,525
Mmmm.

224
00:16:01,597 --> 00:16:04,725
This is a tasty burger ! Vincent !

225
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:07,325
You ever had a Big Kahuna burger ?

226
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,864
Want a bite ? They're real tasty.

227
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:14,374
- I ain't hungry. - Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.

228
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:18,274
Me, I can't usually get 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

229
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,473
which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.

230
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:24,713
But I do love the taste of a good burger. Mmmm.

231
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:29,314
You know what they call a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France ?

232
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,453
- No. - Tell 'em, Vincent.

233
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:35,552
- A Royale with Cheese. - A Royale with Cheese.

234
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:39,092
You know why they call it that ?

235
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:42,232
Uh, because of the metric system ?

236
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:46,602
Check out the big brain on Brett !

237
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,011
You're a smart motherfucker. That's right. The metric system.

238
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:54,473
- What's in this ? - Sprite.

239
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:56,483
Sprite. Good.

240
00:16:56,553 --> 00:17:00,421
You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with ?

241
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:03,352
Go right ahead.

242
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:17,631
That hit the spot.

243
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:21,760
You. Flock of Seagulls. You know why we're here ?

244
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:25,370
- Why don't you tell my man Vince here where you got the shit hid. - It's over--

245
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:29,040
I don't remember askin' you a goddamned thing !

246
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,550
You were sayin' ?

247
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,680
It's in the cupboard.

248
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:42,430
N-No, the one by your kn-knees.

249
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,609
We happy ?

250
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,549
Vincent ?

251
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:11,318
- We happy ? - Yeah, we happy.

252
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:17,686
Look, I'm sorry, uh, l-- I didn't get your name.

253
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:20,956
I got yours. Vincent. Right ? B-But I never got yours.

254
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:26,368
- My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit. - No, no, no.

255
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:30,777
I just want you to know how--

256
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:36,896
I just want you to know how sorry we are th-that things got so fucked up...

257
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:39,177
with us and Mr. Wallace.

258
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:43,747
W-We got into this thing with the best intentions. Really. I never--

259
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:47,215
Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration ?

260
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,886
- I didn't mean to do that. Please.

261
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:55,125
Continue. You were saying something about "best intentions."

262
00:18:56,537 --> 00:19:00,435
What's the matter ? Oh, you were finished !

263
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,235
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

264
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:09,763
What does Marsellus Wallace look like ?

265
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:12,034
What ?

266
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:15,373
- What country you from ? - What ?

267
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:19,713
- "What" ain't no country I ever heard of. They speak English in What ? - W-What ?

268
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,484
- English, motherfucker ! Do you speak it ? - Yes !

269
00:19:22,555 --> 00:19:24,254
- Then you know what I'm sayin' ! - Yes.

270
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:27,762
Describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like !

271
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:30,453
- What ? l-- - Say "what" again !

272
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:34,463
Say "what" again ! I dare ya ! I double dare you, motherfucker !

273
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:38,432
- Say "what" one more goddamn time ! - H-H-He's black.

274
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:40,833
- Go on ! - He's bald !

275
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:43,633
- Does he look like a bitch ? - What ?

276
00:19:45,373 --> 00:19:49,401
Does he look... Iike a bitch ?

277
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:52,712
- No ! - Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch ?

278
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:56,412
- I didn't. - Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett !

279
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:58,652
- You tried to fuck him.- No, no.

280
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:03,992
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

281
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:07,120
- You read the Bible, Brett ? - Yes !

282
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:11,762
Well, there's this passage I got memorized. Sort of fits this occasion.

283
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:14,171
Ezekiel 25:17.

284
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:17,540
"The path of the righteous man...

285
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:21,540
is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish...

286
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:24,550
and the tyranny of evil men.

287
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:29,551
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill,

288
00:20:29,622 --> 00:20:32,780
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,

289
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:35,520
for he is truly his brother's keeper...

290
00:20:35,591 --> 00:20:39,149
and the finder of lost children.

291
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,028
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance...

292
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:45,070
and furious anger...

293
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,799
those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers !

294
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,708
And you will know My name is the Lord...

295
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:57,177
when I lay My vengeance upon thee !"

296
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:18,057
I think you gonna find...

297
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:20,798
when all this shit is over and done--

298
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:26,837
I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker.

299
00:21:28,408 --> 00:21:31,207
The thing is, Butch,

300
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:34,306
right now... you got ability.

301
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:38,417
But painful as it may be,

302
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:41,645
ability... don't last.

303
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:47,715
And your days are just about over.

304
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:52,194
Now, that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life.

305
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:57,295
But that's a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about.

306
00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:04,665
You see, this business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

307
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:08,704
Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine.

308
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:14,143
If you mean it turns to vinegar... it does.

309
00:22:15,386 --> 00:22:19,654
If you mean it gets better with age... it don't.

310
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:23,294
Besides, Butch,

311
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:28,653
how many fights you think you got in you anyway ?

312
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:30,924
Hmm ?

313
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:32,964
Two ?

314
00:22:34,075 --> 00:22:37,473
Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.

315
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:42,562
You came close, but you never made it.

316
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:46,842
And if you were gonna make it, you would have made it before now.

317
00:23:03,562 --> 00:23:05,831
You my nigger ?

318
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:12,901
Certainly appears so.

319
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:23,279
The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting.

320
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:29,789
That's pride fuckin' with you.

321
00:23:30,861 --> 00:23:33,450
Fuck pride !

322
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,218
Pride only hurts.

323
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,229
It never helps.

324
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,690
You fight through that shit. 

325
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:50,110
'Cause a year from now, when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,

326
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,119
you gonna say to yourself, "Marsellus Wallace was right."

327
00:23:57,089 --> 00:24:01,357
I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace.

328
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:05,227
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

329
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,238
Say it.

330
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:16,936
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

331
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:21,397
Yo, Vincent Vega. Our man in Amsterdam.

332
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:25,937
Jules Winfield, our man in lnglewood. Get your asses on in here.

333
00:24:26,018 --> 00:24:29,846
- Goddamn, nigger, what's up with them clothes ? - You don't even want to know.

334
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:33,186
Where's the big man ?

335
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:36,186
The big man's right over there takin' care of some business.

336
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:40,716
Why don't you hang back a second or two. You see the white boy leave, go on over.

337
00:24:43,437 --> 00:24:45,696
How ya been ?

338
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:49,704
- I been doin' pretty good. How 'bout yourself ? - All right.

339
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:54,175
So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow.

340
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:59,505
At Marsellus's request.

341
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:03,345
- Have you met Mia ? - Not yet.

342
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:06,613
- What's so fuckin' funny ?

343
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:09,284
- Not a goddamn thing. - I got to piss.

344
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:13,624
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right ? It's the big man's wife.

345
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:16,355
I'm gonna sit across from her, chew my food with my mouth closed,

346
00:25:16,435 --> 00:25:18,394
Iaugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.

347
00:25:18,465 --> 00:25:21,593
Hey, my name's Paul, and this shit's between y'all.

348
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,722
Then what'd you fuckin' ask me about it for ?

349
00:25:24,804 --> 00:25:27,293
Asshole.

350
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:35,743
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples. - Filters ?

351
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:37,753
No.

352
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:44,482
- You lookin' at somethin', friend ? - You ain't my friend, palooka.

353
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:50,082
-What was that ? -I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

354
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:52,753
Vincent Vega's in the house ?

355
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:56,131
My nigger, get your ass over here.

356
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:06,502
- What's up ? - Man, I'm really sorry.

357
00:26:06,582 --> 00:26:08,741
You shouldn't worry about it.

358
00:26:08,812 --> 00:26:11,781
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

359
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,621
And some matches.

360
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:21,660
Thanks.

361
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:27,859
It's as if it turns every part of your body into the tip of a penis.

362
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:31,829
- Whoa. - I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on piercing.

363
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:36,299
That gun to pierce your ears, they don't use that to pierce your nipples, do they ?

364
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,238
Forget that gun. That guns goes against the entire idea behind piercing.

365
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:45,180
All my piercing, 18 places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle.

366
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,738
Five in each ear, one through the nipple of my left breast,

367
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,948
two in my right nostril, one in my left eyebrow,

368
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,889
one in my belly, one in my lip, one in my clit,

369
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:58,417
- and I wear a stud in my tongue. -  Excuse me.

370
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,429
I was just curious,

371
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:04,357
but, um... why would you wear a stud in your tongue ?

372
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:07,927
Sex thing. Helps fellatio.

373
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:11,957
Vincenzo. Step in my office.

374
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:21,807
This is Panda from Mexico. Very good stuff.

375
00:27:21,878 --> 00:27:25,316
Now, that's Bava. Different, but equally good.

376
00:27:25,388 --> 00:27:28,317
And that is Choco from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

377
00:27:28,388 --> 00:27:32,826
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

378
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:35,857
But this one is a little more expensive.

379
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:38,326
This is 500 a gram.

380
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:41,795
But, when you shoot it, you will know where that extra money went.

381
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:45,965
There's nothing wrong with these two. This is real, real, real good shit.

382
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:49,695
But this one is a fuckin' madman.

383
00:27:49,777 --> 00:27:52,536
Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.

384
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:55,635
Am I a nigger ? Are we in lnglewood ? No.

385
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,874
You're in my home. Now, white people who know the difference...

386
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:01,944
between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to.

387
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:05,383
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

388
00:28:05,455 --> 00:28:08,753
- any old day of the fuckin' week. - That's a bold statement.

389
00:28:08,826 --> 00:28:12,694
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a seller's market.

390
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:16,754
Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead.

391
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:20,703
Heroin, it's comin' back in a big fuckin' way.

392
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:25,433
- All right. Gimme three grams of madman. - Okay.

393
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:28,943
Now, if it's as good as you say it is, I'll come back and buy another thousand.

394
00:28:29,014 --> 00:28:31,773
I just hope that I still have some left for ya,

395
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:36,042
but I'm givin' you some out of my own private stash.

396
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,282
That is what a nice guy I am.

397
00:28:39,354 --> 00:28:43,452
- I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right ? - Yeah, that's cool.

398
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:45,513
All right. I'll just get one for ya.

399
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:50,533
Honey, will you get me some baggies and, uh, twistix from the kitchen ?

400
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,562
Okay.

401
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:56,161
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi ? She ain't got a boyfriend.

402
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:59,530
- You wanna hang out and get high ? - Which one's Trudi ?

403
00:28:59,602 --> 00:29:03,770
-The one with all the shit in her face ? -No, that's Jody.

404
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:06,282
That's my wife.

405
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:10,942
- I'm sorry, man. - Thank you.

406
00:29:11,022 --> 00:29:14,880
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace. - All right, no problemo.

407
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:17,681
- I'll take a rain check.

408
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:21,089
- Oh. - Thank you, Jody.

409
00:29:21,162 --> 00:29:24,460
Still got your Malibu ?

410
00:29:24,532 --> 00:29:27,620
Oh, man, you know what some fucker did the other day ?

411
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:29,630
- What ? - Fuckin' keyed it.

412
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:33,299
- Oh, man, that's fucked up. - Tell me about it.

413
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,070
I had it in storage for three years.

414
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,478
It was out five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

415
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:44,978
They should be fuckin' killed, man. No trial, no jury, straight to execution.

416
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:49,779
I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd have given anything to catch that asshole.

417
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:54,588
- It'd been worth him doin' it just so I could've caught him. - What a fucker !

418
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,459
What's more chicken-shit than fuckin' with a man's automobile ?

419
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,429
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle. - You don't do it.

420
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,899
- It's just against the rules. - Thank you.

421
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,128
Thank you.

422
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,998
- Mind if I shoot up here ? - Hey, mi casa es su casa.

423
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:11,367
Muchas gracias.

424
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:58,400
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed. The door's open.

425
00:31:58,472 --> 00:32:02,670
Come inside and make yourself a drink. Mia.

426
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:13,550
Hello ?

427
00:32:13,622 --> 00:32:18,111
Billy Raye was a preacher's son and when his daddy would visit he'd come along

428
00:32:18,192 --> 00:32:20,321
Vincent.

429
00:32:22,562 --> 00:32:24,891
Vincent.

430
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:26,900
I'm on the intercom.

431
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:29,590
Where is-- Where is the intercom ?

432
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,998
It's on the wall by the two African fellows.

433
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,169
To your right.

434
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,399
Warm.

435
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:42,570
Warmer.

436
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,639
Disco.

437
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,309
Hello ?

438
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:50,717
Push the button if you want to talk.

439
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:52,848
Hello ?

440
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,757
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

441
00:32:56,829 --> 00:33:00,227
The bar's by the fireplace.

442
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:04,158
Okay.

443
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,668
When he started sweet talkin' to me

444
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:09,498
He come and tell me everything is all right

445
00:33:09,578 --> 00:33:12,237
He'd kiss me and tell me everything is all right

446
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:14,248
Can I get away again tonight

447
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:16,907
The only one who could ever reach me

448
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:19,607
Was the son of a preacher man

449
00:33:19,688 --> 00:33:22,746
The only boy who could ever teach me

450
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:25,786
Was the son of a preacher man Yes, he was

451
00:33:25,857 --> 00:33:28,156
He was

452
00:33:28,227 --> 00:33:30,856
-  Lord he knows he was -  Yes he was

453
00:33:33,498 --> 00:33:35,927
How will I remember

454
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:38,726
The look was in his eyes

455
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:41,296
Stealing kisses from me on the sly

456
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:43,965
Taking time to make time

457
00:33:44,036 --> 00:33:46,525
Telling me that he's all mine

458
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,546
-  Learning from each other's knowin'

459
00:33:49,616 --> 00:33:51,705
Looking to see how much we've grown

460
00:33:51,777 --> 00:33:54,246
And the only one who could ever reach me

461
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:56,575
Was the son of a preacher man

462
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:59,625
The only boy who could ever teach me

What the fuck is this place ?

This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

469
00:34:20,844 --> 00:34:23,173
- An Elvis man should love it.

470
00:34:23,245 --> 00:34:27,443
- Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak. - You can get a steak here, daddy-o.

Thank you.

502
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:37,555
Call for...

503
00:36:37,637 --> 00:36:42,236
- Phil-lip Mor-ris. - What do you think ?

504
00:36:42,306 --> 00:36:47,005
I think it's like a wax museum with a pulse.

505
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:50,915
Hi, I'm Buddy. What can I get you ?

506
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:57,784
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh, yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

507
00:36:57,855 --> 00:37:00,654
- I'll have that. - How do you want that cooked ?

508
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:04,023
- Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell ? - Bloody as hell, and--

509
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,825
Oh, yeah, look at this-- vanilla Coke.

510
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:08,864
What about you, Peggy Sue ?

511
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,263
I'll have the...

512
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:16,673
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.

513
00:37:16,745 --> 00:37:20,643
And... a five-dollar shake.

514
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:23,444
How do you want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy ?

515
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:27,643
- Martin and Lewis. - Did you just order a five-dollar shake ?

516
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:29,773
Mm-hmm.

517
00:37:29,854 --> 00:37:33,012
That's a shake ? That's milk and ice cream ?

518
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:37,491
- Last I heard. - That's five dollars ? You don't put bourbon in it or nothin' ?

519
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:39,922
- No. - Just checking.

520
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:42,693
I'll be right back with your drinks.

521
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:44,702
To Lonesome Town

522
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:48,721
To cry my troubles away

523
00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:54,401
Could you, um... roll me one of those, cowboy ?

524
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,341
You can have this one, cowgirl.

525
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:59,342
- Thanks.

526
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:01,811
The streets are filled with regret

527
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:06,111
Think nothin' of it.

528
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:10,020
Lay me down in Lonesome Town

529
00:38:10,092 --> 00:38:13,620
-  I can learn to forget - So...

530
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,789
Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.

531
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,990
- Sure did. - How long were you there ?

532
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:22,591
Just over three years.

533
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:27,970
I go there about once a year to chill out for a month.

534
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:31,769
No kiddin' ? I didn't know that.

535
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,779
Why would you ?

536
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,389
I heard you did a pilot.

537
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,348
- That was my 15 minutes. - What was it ?

538
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:51,129
It was a show about a team of female secret agents called Fox Force Five.

539
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,929
- What ? - Fox Force Five.

540
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,258
Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.

541
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,798
Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with.

542
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,638
And five, as in there's one-two-three-four-five of us.

543
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:05,397
There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

544
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:08,606
The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.

545
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,737
The black girl was a demolition expert.

546
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:15,688
French fox's speciality was sex.

547
00:39:15,758 --> 00:39:20,116
- What was your speciality ? - Knives.

548
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,226
The character I played, Raven McCoy,

549
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:26,156
her background was she grew up raised by circus performers.

550
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:30,496
According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife.

551
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,327
And she knew a zillion old jokes.

552
00:39:33,397 --> 00:39:37,525
Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her.

553
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:40,904
And if we would have got picked up, they would've worked in a gimmick...

554
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:44,844
where every show I would've told another joke.

555
00:39:46,047 --> 00:39:48,806
You know any of them old jokes ?

556
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,615
Well, I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show.

557
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:55,245
- Tell me. - It's corny.

558
00:39:56,155 --> 00:39:58,244
Don't be that way. Tell me.

559
00:39:58,325 --> 00:40:02,023
- No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed. - You'd be embarr--

560
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:06,034
You told 50 million people, and you can't tell me ?

561
00:40:06,096 --> 00:40:09,964
- I promise I won't laugh. - That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

562
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,364
That's not what I meant. You know it.

563
00:40:12,435 --> 00:40:15,873
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much.

564
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:18,534
What a gyp.

565
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:22,074
Martin and Lewis.

566
00:40:25,154 --> 00:40:27,553
Vanilla Coke.

567
00:40:31,893 --> 00:40:35,221
Mmm. Yummy.

568
00:40:35,293 --> 00:40:38,262
You think I could have a sip of that ?

569
00:40:39,794 --> 00:40:41,963
Be my guest.

570
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:46,062
I gotta know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.

571
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:49,591
- You can use my straw. I don't have cooties. - Yeah, but maybe I do.

572
00:40:49,672 --> 00:40:52,541
Cooties I can handle.

573
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:54,581
All right.

574
00:41:01,652 --> 00:41:04,451
Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milkshake !

575
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:08,580
-Told ya. -I don't know if it was worth $5, but it's pretty fuckin' good.

576
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,047
- Don't you hate that ? - Hate what ?

577
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,458
Uncomfortable silences.

578
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:55,988
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable ?

579
00:41:56,069 --> 00:42:00,007
I don't know. That's a good question.

580
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:04,808
That's when you know you found somebody really special.

581
00:42:04,878 --> 00:42:09,577
When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.

582
00:42:09,648 --> 00:42:13,746
Well, I don't think we're quite there yet, but don't feel bad. We just met each other.

583
00:42:15,258 --> 00:42:18,376
I'll tell you what.

584
00:42:18,457 --> 00:42:21,715
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose.

585
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:24,985
You sit here... and think of something to say.

586
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:28,167
I'll do that.

587
00:42:30,497 --> 00:42:32,436
Okay.

588
00:42:57,695 --> 00:42:59,884
I said goddamn !

589
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:03,124
Goddamn ! Goddamn.

590
00:43:05,735 --> 00:43:08,324
I need some hair spray.

591
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,164
Mmmm.

592
00:43:16,244 --> 00:43:20,572
Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom to find your food waiting for you ?

593
00:43:20,644 --> 00:43:23,043
We're lucky we got anything at all.

594
00:43:23,115 --> 00:43:26,243
I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.

595
00:43:26,324 --> 00:43:29,452
Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.

596
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,581
- Which one ? There's two Monroes. - No, there's not.

597
00:43:32,663 --> 00:43:34,992
That is Marilyn Monroe.

598
00:43:35,063 --> 00:43:37,792
That is Mamie Van Doren.

599
00:43:37,864 --> 00:43:42,803
I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so she must have the night off.

600
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:46,301
- Pretty smart. - Yeah. I got my moments.

601
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:50,741
- So did you think of somethin' to say ? - Actually, I did.

602
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:54,341
However...

603
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:59,071
you seem like a really nice person, and l--

604
00:43:59,152 --> 00:44:01,981
- I don't want to offend you. - Oooh.

605
00:44:02,052 --> 00:44:07,251
This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

606
00:44:07,322 --> 00:44:10,320
This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say.

607
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:13,230
Well, well, I do. I do.

608
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:17,360
-  But you have to promise not to be offended. - No, no.

609
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:21,669
You can't promise somethin' like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

610
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:26,610
You can ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to get offended.

611
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,039
Then, through no fault of my own, I would have broken my promise.

612
00:44:29,111 --> 00:44:31,810
- Let's just forget it. - That's an impossibility.

613
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,938
Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.

614
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,219
- Is that a fact ? - And besides,

615
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:43,319
- isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't have permission ? - All right, all right.

616
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,189
Well, here goes.

617
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:49,287
What did you think about what happened to Antwan ?

618
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:52,798
- Who's Antwan ? - Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

619
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:56,097
- He fell out of a window. - Hmm. Hmm.

620
00:44:56,169 --> 00:45:00,868
Well, that is one way to say it. Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out.

621
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:04,107
Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus.

622
00:45:04,178 --> 00:45:09,307
Yet even another way is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.

623
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:11,818
- Is that a fact ? - No.

624
00:45:11,888 --> 00:45:15,016
No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard. That's just what I heard.

625
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:17,987
- Who told you ? - They.

626
00:45:18,058 --> 00:45:20,527
"They" talk a lot, don't they ?

627
00:45:22,698 --> 00:45:25,357
They certainly do. They certainly do.

628
00:45:25,437 --> 00:45:29,835
- Don't be shy, Vincent. What else did "they" say ? - I'm-- I'm not shy.

629
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:32,426
- Um-- - Did it involve the "F" word ?

630
00:45:32,507 --> 00:45:36,495
No, no, no, no, no. They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage.

631
00:45:38,046 --> 00:45:40,675
- And ? - And-- And nothin'.

632
00:45:40,747 --> 00:45:43,616
That's it.

633
00:45:43,686 --> 00:45:45,745
You heard Marsellus...

634
00:45:45,817 --> 00:45:50,185
threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story window for giving me a foot massage ?

635
00:45:50,256 --> 00:45:52,195
- Mm-hmm. - And you believe that ?

636
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:56,784
Well, at the time I was told it sounded reasonable.

637
00:45:56,865 --> 00:45:59,953
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourth-story window...

638
00:46:00,036 --> 00:46:03,094
for massaging my feet seemed reasonable ?

639
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:06,624
No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

640
00:46:06,705 --> 00:46:09,364
I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you.

641
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:14,074
A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.

642
00:46:14,144 --> 00:46:17,872
A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.

643
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:20,544
But did it happen ?

644
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:26,454
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.

645
00:46:26,524 --> 00:46:28,923
Really ?

646
00:46:28,993 --> 00:46:32,321
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window...

647
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:34,332
except Marsellus and Tony.

648
00:46:34,404 --> 00:46:38,392
When you little scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.

649
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:42,402
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment you've all been waiting for.

650
00:46:42,473 --> 00:46:47,502
The world-famous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

651
00:46:49,912 --> 00:46:54,240
Now, this is where one lucky couple...

652
00:46:54,323 --> 00:46:58,781
will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding.

653
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:02,410
Now, who will be our first contestants ?

654
00:47:02,492 --> 00:47:04,751
- Right here ! -  All right !

655
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:07,849
- I wanna dance. - No, no, no, no, no.

656
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:12,660
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss,

657
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:16,169
told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted.

658
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:19,929
Now I wanna dance; I wanna win; I want that trophy.

659
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:21,220
- So dance good. - All right. You asked for it.

660
00:47:21,221 --> 00:47:22,550
- So dance good. - All right. You asked for it.

661
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,589
Let's hear it for our first contestants.

662
00:47:30,191 --> 00:47:35,460
Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening. Young lady, what is your name ?

663
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,519
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

664
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,229
And how 'bout your fella here ?

665
00:47:40,299 --> 00:47:42,128
Vincent Vega.

666
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:45,637
All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away !

667
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:48,639
-  Go for it. -  Come on !

668
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:10,886
It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well

669
00:48:12,898 --> 00:48:16,856
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle

670
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:23,035
And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell

671
00:48:25,007 --> 00:48:29,305
C'est la vie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell

672
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:35,345
They furnished off an apartment with a two-room Roebucks sale

673
00:48:37,256 --> 00:48:41,524
The 'coolerador was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale

674
00:48:43,397 --> 00:48:47,295
But when Pierre found work the little money comin' worked out well

675
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:53,664
C'est la vie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell

676
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:59,743
They had a hi-fi phono and boy did they let it blast

677
00:49:01,776 --> 00:49:06,044
Seven hundred little records all rock, rhythm and jazz

678
00:49:07,785 --> 00:49:11,883
But when the sun went down the rapid tempo of the music fell

679
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:18,853
C'est la vie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell

680
00:49:44,352 --> 00:49:48,580
They had a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well

681
00:49:50,623 --> 00:49:54,581
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle

682
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,988
Is that what you call an uncomfortable silence ?

683
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:36,428
I don't know what you call that.

684
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,129
- Drinks ! Music !

685
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,369
I'm gonna take a piss.

686
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:47,398
That's a little bit more information than I needed, but go right ahead.

687
00:51:00,488 --> 00:51:02,387
Girl

688
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,328
Bomp, bomp, bom

689
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:07,886
You'll be a woman soon

690
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,537
I love you so much Can't count all the ways

691
00:51:13,607 --> 00:51:16,595
I'd die for you, girl and all they can say is

692
00:51:16,677 --> 00:51:19,865
He's not your kind

693
00:51:19,948 --> 00:51:25,177
You never get tired of putting me down and I never know when I come around

694
00:51:25,247 --> 00:51:27,616
What I'm gonna find

695
00:51:27,687 --> 00:51:31,775
Don't let them make up your mind

696
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:34,715
Don't you know, girl

697
00:51:36,086 --> 00:51:39,714
You'll be a woman soon

698
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:42,885
One drink, and that's it.

699
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:46,795
Don't be rude. Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

700
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:50,835
Say good night... and go home.

701
00:51:53,245 --> 00:51:57,373
You'll be a woman soon

702
00:51:58,575 --> 00:52:00,634
Soon

703
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:05,183
You'll be a woman

704
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:09,653
I've been misunderstood for all of my life

705
00:52:09,725 --> 00:52:12,054
But what they're sayin', girl it cuts like a knife

706
00:52:12,124 --> 00:52:14,493
The boy's no good

707
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:17,254
Well, I've finally have found what I been lookin' for

708
00:52:17,335 --> 00:52:21,733
But if they get a chance they'll end it for sure Sure they would

709
00:52:21,804 --> 00:52:24,493
Baby, I've done all I could

710
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:29,233
You see, this is a moral test of oneself.

711
00:52:29,303 --> 00:52:32,571
Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.

712
00:52:32,644 --> 00:52:35,942
Because... being loyal is very important.

713
00:52:36,014 --> 00:52:40,613
You never get tired of putting me down and I never know when I come around

714
00:52:40,683 --> 00:52:43,312
What I'm gonna find

715
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:47,340
Don't let them make up your mind

716
00:52:47,422 --> 00:52:50,261
Don't you know, girl

717
00:52:51,862 --> 00:52:55,690
You'll be a woman soon

718
00:52:57,232 --> 00:52:59,171

00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:29,599
So, you're gonna go out there and you're gonna say, "Good night.

00:53:29,661 --> 00:53:32,190
I've had a very lovely evening."

728
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:37,329
Walk out the door, get in the car, go home, jerk off, and that's all you gonna do.

729
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,109
Now it's up to you, girl

You'll be a woman

737
00:54:25,147 --> 00:54:27,446
All right, Mia.

738
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:30,615
So listen, I gotta go, all right ?

739
00:54:33,756 --> 00:54:37,124
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

Answer.

746
00:55:11,114 --> 00:55:13,543
Have you got the ring ?

747
00:55:13,615 --> 00:55:17,443
- Why, certainly. - Join hands, you two lovebirds.

748

Fuck you, Lance ! Answer !

00:55:36,163 --> 00:55:38,102
Now what do you say ?

00:55:38,173 --> 00:55:41,102
I give up ! I'll marry you !

753
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:45,831
- Lance ! The goddamn phone's ringing !

754
00:55:47,543 --> 00:55:49,482
I can hear it.

755
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:52,981
I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call here this late !

756
00:55:53,052 --> 00:55:54,981
Yeah, I told them.

757
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:58,310
And that is exactly what I'm going to tell this fucking asshole right now.

758
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:02,720
-Don't you dare strike me ! - Hello.

759
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:05,050
Lance ! Vincent.

760
00:56:05,132 --> 00:56:08,061
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man. I'm coming to your house.

761
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:12,219
W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man. W-What's the problem ?

762
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:15,559
- I got this chick, she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me ! - Well, don't bring her here !

763
00:56:15,641 --> 00:56:19,969
I'm not even joking with you ! Do not be bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house !

764
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,099
- No choice. - Wh-- She's O.D.in' ?

765
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,368
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man ! -  Just dandy.

766
00:56:25,451 --> 00:56:29,639
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet, take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.

767
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,149
- Negative ! - This is not my fuckin' problem, man !

768
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,948
You fucked her up, you fuckin' deal with this !

769
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,859
Uh, are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone ?

770
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:41,358
I don't know you. Who is this ? Don't come here !

771
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,758
I'm hanging up the phone ! Prank caller ! Prank caller !

772
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:55,777
- What the hell was that ?

773
00:56:57,738 --> 00:57:00,177
Have you lost your fucking mind ?

774
00:57:00,249 --> 00:57:03,178
- You were talking about drug shit on a cellular phone ! - Lance, help me.

775
00:57:03,249 --> 00:57:06,188
- You crashed your car into my fucking house ! - Grab her feet.

776
00:57:06,248 --> 00:57:09,686
Are you deaf ? You are not bringing this fucked-up bitch into my house !

777
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:12,687
This "fucked-up bitch" is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

778
00:57:12,758 --> 00:57:15,187
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is ? - Yeah.

779
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:18,196
If she croaks on me, I am a fucking grease spot !

780
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:22,857
I will be forced to tell him that you did not help and let her die on your lawn.

781
00:57:22,937 --> 00:57:25,866
Now, come on. Help me, help me. Pick her up.

782
00:57:26,937 --> 00:57:28,866
- Shit.

783
00:57:30,937 --> 00:57:33,306
Lance !

784
00:57:33,376 --> 00:57:35,305
Shit.

785
00:57:35,377 --> 00:57:37,816
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

786
00:57:37,886 --> 00:57:41,214
What the fuck's going on out here ?

787
00:57:41,286 --> 00:57:43,215
Who's she ?

788
00:57:43,286 --> 00:57:46,225
Go to the fridge and get the thing with the adrenalin shot.

789
00:57:46,285 --> 00:57:48,344
- What's wrong with her ? - She's O.D.ing !

790
00:57:48,426 --> 00:57:50,485
- Get her outta here ! -  Get the shot !

791
00:57:50,555 --> 00:57:54,083
- Fuck you ! Fuck you too ! - What a fuckin' bitch.

792
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:56,095
Just keep talking to her, all right ?

793
00:57:56,165 --> 00:57:59,094
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to go get my little black medical book.

794
00:57:59,165 --> 00:58:01,154
What the fuck you need a medical book for ?

795
00:58:01,235 --> 00:58:03,174
I've never had to give an adrenalin shot before !

796
00:58:03,235 --> 00:58:06,673
I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers ! My friends can handle their highs !

797
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:09,173
- Get the shot ! - I am, if you'll let me !

798
00:58:09,244 --> 00:58:12,173
- I ain't stopping you ! - Stop talking to me. Start talking to her !

799
00:58:12,245 --> 00:58:14,184
- Get the shot ! - All right !

800
00:58:17,354 --> 00:58:20,782
-Hurry up. We're losing her ! - I'm looking as fast as I can !

801
00:58:20,854 --> 00:58:22,793
What's he looking for ?

802
00:58:22,853 --> 00:58:25,792
- I don't know. Some book. - What are you looking for ?

803
00:58:25,863 --> 00:58:28,792
- A little black medical book. - What are you looking for ?

804
00:58:28,864 --> 00:58:32,962
My little black medical book ! It's like a textbook they give to nurses.

805
00:58:33,034 --> 00:58:35,973
- I never saw no medical book. - Trust me. I have one.

806
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:38,972
- If it's so important, why don't you keep it with the shot ? - I don't know !

807
00:58:39,043 --> 00:58:42,971
- Stop bothering me ! - While you're looking, that girl's gonna die on our carpet.

808
00:58:43,042 --> 00:58:44,971
You're never gonna find anything in this mess !

809
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:48,940
- I'm gonna fucking kill you if you don't shut up ! - Lance, get in here !

810
00:58:49,012 --> 00:58:53,240
- Right ? Pig. - Get the fuck outta my way.

811
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:56,750
- Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot. - While I'm doing this,

812
00:58:56,822 --> 00:59:00,150
you take off her shirt and find her heart.

813
00:59:00,221 --> 00:59:03,779
- Does it gotta be exact ? - We're giving her a shot in the heart, so it's gotta be exact.

814
00:59:03,862 --> 00:59:06,801
I don't know exactly where her heart is. I think it's right here.

815
00:59:06,861 --> 00:59:10,529
- That's it. - All right, what I need is a big, fat magic marker.

816
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:12,530
- You got it ? - What ?

817
00:59:12,601 --> 00:59:15,300
A magic marker. A felt pen !

818
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:17,999
A fuckin' black magic marker ! Christ.

819
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:23,139
- Come on, man. Hurry up ! - Fuck ! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.

820
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:28,810
- Hurry up, man. - I'll tell you what to do.

821
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:31,819
- You're gonna give her the shot. - No, you're gonna give her the shot.

822
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:34,819
- I ain't giving her the shot. I never done this before. - I never done this either !

823
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:37,878
I ain't starting now ! You brought her here. You give her the shot.

824
00:59:37,959 --> 00:59:41,357
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to your house, then I give her the shot.

825
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:43,369
Give it to me. Give me that.

826
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:46,369
All right, tell me what to do.

827
00:59:46,439 --> 00:59:49,427
Okay, you're giving her an injection of adrenalin straight to her heart.

828
00:59:49,509 --> 00:59:52,438
- But she's got a breastplate-- You gotta pierce through that.

829
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:55,438
You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.

830
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,946
- I gotta-- I gotta stab her three times ? - No, just stab her once !

831
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:02,447
But it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart.

832
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:05,448
Once you do that, you p-press down on the p-plunger.

833
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:08,007
- Okay. Then what happens ? - Kinda curious about that myself.

834
01:00:08,088 --> 01:00:11,027
This ain't no fuckin' joke ! Am I gonna kill her ?

835
01:00:11,088 --> 01:00:14,526
- She's supposed to come out of it like that. It's-- - All right, count to three.

836
01:00:14,598 --> 01:00:16,787
- All right. Ready ? - One.

837
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:23,596
Two.

838
01:00:31,576 --> 01:00:33,545
Three !

839
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:51,393
If you're all right, then say something.

840
01:00:51,466 --> 01:00:54,484
Something.

841
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:56,504
That was fuckin' trippy.

842
01:00:59,075 --> 01:01:02,403
- Ohh. - Oh, man.

843
01:01:27,094 --> 01:01:29,033
Mia. Mia.

844
01:01:31,204 --> 01:01:33,633
What's--

845
01:01:33,703 --> 01:01:36,502
What's your thoughts on-- on--

846
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:38,602
on how to handle this ?

847
01:01:38,672 --> 01:01:40,611
What's yours ?

848
01:01:43,682 --> 01:01:47,580
Well, I'm of the opinion that if Marsellus lived his whole life,

849
01:01:47,652 --> 01:01:51,650
he doesn't need to know nothing about this incident.

850
01:01:51,782 --> 01:01:54,581
If Marsellus knew about this incident,

851
01:01:54,652 --> 01:01:56,711
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

852
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:59,280
I seriously doubt that.

853
01:01:59,351 --> 01:02:02,290
I can keep a secret if you can.

854
01:02:04,332 --> 01:02:06,261
Shake on it ?

855
01:02:11,471 --> 01:02:13,760
Mum's the word ?

856
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,769
Cool.

857
01:02:15,841 --> 01:02:20,169
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.

858
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:24,839
Vincent.

859
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:29,738
Do you wanna hear my Fox Force Five joke ?

860
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,749
Sure.

861
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:35,848
Except I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.

862
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:38,858
No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.

863
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:42,258
But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.

864
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:44,519
- I can't wait. - Okay.

865
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:47,468
Three tomatoes are walkin' down the street.

866
01:02:47,529 --> 01:02:49,968
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato and Baby Tomato.

867
01:02:50,038 --> 01:02:54,196
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind, and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

868
01:02:54,268 --> 01:02:57,207
Goes back and squishes him and says,

869
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,368
"Ketchup."

870
01:03:02,218 --> 01:03:04,147
Ketchup.

871
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,416
See you around.

872
01:03:31,477 --> 01:03:35,175
Oh, that Paddlefoot. He funny, silly dog.

873
01:03:35,247 --> 01:03:38,176
He think totem pole alive !

874
01:03:38,246 --> 01:03:40,975
He arctic tenderfoot !

875
01:03:41,046 --> 01:03:44,714
That totem pole been here forever !

876
01:03:44,786 --> 01:03:46,725
- Butch ?

877
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:49,654
One more thing, and we'll start for--

878
01:03:49,726 --> 01:03:52,665
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second. - Yeah ?

879
01:03:52,725 --> 01:03:56,353
- You've got a special visitor. - Stand up. Stand up.

880
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:04,074
Now, do you remember when I told you your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp ?

881
01:04:04,134 --> 01:04:07,872
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

882
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:10,874
He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

883
01:04:16,214 --> 01:04:18,153
Hello, little man.

884
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:22,312
Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.

885
01:04:22,393 --> 01:04:25,621
See, I was a good friend of your dad's.

886
01:04:25,694 --> 01:04:28,722
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together...

887
01:04:28,794 --> 01:04:31,263
over five years.

888
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:33,262
Hopefully...

889
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:36,272
you'll never have to experience this yourself,

890
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:39,770
but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were...

891
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,641
for as long as we were,

892
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:47,011
you take on certain responsibilities of the other.

893
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,012
If it'd been me who'd--

894
01:04:50,352 --> 01:04:52,281
not made it,

895
01:04:52,352 --> 01:04:56,620
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim.

896
01:04:56,692 --> 01:05:00,350
But the way it turned out, I'm talking to you.

897
01:05:01,762 --> 01:05:03,691
Butch...

898
01:05:05,232 --> 01:05:07,161
I got something for ya.

899
01:05:13,671 --> 01:05:15,730
This watch I got here...

900
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:20,609
was first purchased by your great-grandfather during the first World War.

901
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:25,340
It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee.

902
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,978
Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches.

903
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,989
Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches.

904
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:35,218
It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

905
01:05:35,289 --> 01:05:38,228
on the day he set sail for Paris.

906
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,729
This was your great-grandfather's war watch,

907
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:44,158
and he wore it every day he was in that war, and...

908
01:05:44,229 --> 01:05:47,797
when he'd done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother,

909
01:05:47,868 --> 01:05:52,306
took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed...

910
01:05:52,378 --> 01:05:56,806
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country...

911
01:05:56,878 --> 01:06:00,606
to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.

912
01:06:00,678 --> 01:06:04,136
This time they called it World War ll.

913
01:06:04,218 --> 01:06:09,217
Your great-grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck.

914
01:06:09,287 --> 01:06:12,285
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's.

915
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:15,297
Dane was a Marine, and he was killed...

916
01:06:15,367 --> 01:06:19,385
along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake lsland.

917
01:06:19,467 --> 01:06:22,396
Your granddad was facing death.

918
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:24,406
He knew it.

919
01:06:24,466 --> 01:06:28,404
None of those boys ever had any illusions about leaving that island alive,

920
01:06:28,476 --> 01:06:31,674
so three days before the Japanese took the island,

921
01:06:31,747 --> 01:06:36,976
your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki--

922
01:06:37,046 --> 01:06:39,985
a man he'd never met before in his life--

923
01:06:40,056 --> 01:06:43,025
to deliver to his infant son,

924
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:47,685
who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch.

925
01:06:47,756 --> 01:06:52,094
Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

926
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:56,434
After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother,

927
01:06:56,505 --> 01:07:00,733
delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch.

928
01:07:00,805 --> 01:07:02,744
This watch.

929
01:07:08,614 --> 01:07:14,053
This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi.

930
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:17,552
He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

931
01:07:17,623 --> 01:07:21,681
He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch,

932
01:07:21,763 --> 01:07:25,281
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

933
01:07:25,364 --> 01:07:29,062
The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright.

934
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:33,071
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,

935
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:37,071
so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide something-- his ass.

936
01:07:37,143 --> 01:07:40,571
Five long years he wore this watch up his ass.

937
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:44,841
Then he died of dysentery-- He give me the watch.

938
01:07:44,912 --> 01:07:48,780
I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years.

939
01:07:48,852 --> 01:07:50,781
Then...

940
01:07:50,852 --> 01:07:54,910
after seven years, I was sent home to my family and...

941
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:56,921
now...

942
01:07:59,362 --> 01:08:02,291
Iittle man, I give the watch to you.

943
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:27,089
It's time, Butch.

944
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:37,759
ln the heavyweight division,

945
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:40,987
- in the right corner wearing the blue trunks,

946
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:44,327
weighing 210 pounds,

947
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:47,527
Floyd Ray Wilson !

948
01:08:50,608 --> 01:08:52,537
It's official. It's official.

949
01:08:52,609 --> 01:08:55,548
- Wilson is dead ! - Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest,

950
01:08:55,618 --> 01:08:58,047
hands down, the most brutal fight this city's ever seen.

951
01:08:58,118 --> 01:09:01,706
Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.

952
01:09:01,788 --> 01:09:04,717
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead ? - My guess would be yes.

953
01:09:04,787 --> 01:09:08,225
I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing.

954
01:09:08,297 --> 01:09:11,725
- I think any man would've left the ring that fast. - Do you feel this tragedy...

955
01:09:11,798 --> 01:09:13,727
is gonna affect the world of boxing ?

956
01:09:13,797 --> 01:09:17,735
A tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations.

957
01:09:17,797 --> 01:09:21,735
It's of paramount importance, during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain--

958
01:09:56,575 --> 01:09:58,904
Man, you know I didn't--

959
01:09:58,975 --> 01:10:01,904
- Marsellus. - No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

960
01:10:01,974 --> 01:10:03,913
I didn't do it.

961
01:10:03,975 --> 01:10:06,474
- How you doing ? - Great.

962
01:10:06,544 --> 01:10:08,983
I never thanked you for dinner.

963
01:10:10,884 --> 01:10:12,823
- What you got ? - He booked.

964
01:10:12,884 --> 01:10:15,982
- His trainer ? - Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.

965
01:10:16,053 --> 01:10:19,491
- I think Butch surprised his ass same as us. - No, we don't wanna "think."

966
01:10:19,563 --> 01:10:23,151
We wanna know. Take him to the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

967
01:10:23,234 --> 01:10:26,662
We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't.

968
01:10:26,734 --> 01:10:28,663
Butch's search-- How do you want it done ?

969
01:10:28,733 --> 01:10:31,672
I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker.

970
01:10:31,743 --> 01:10:35,171
If Butch goes to lndochina, I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

971
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:37,372
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

972
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:39,581
I will take care of it.

973
01:10:49,322 --> 01:10:51,691
Mister.

974
01:10:54,591 --> 01:10:57,080
- Hey, mister. - What ?

975
01:10:57,162 --> 01:11:01,961
You were in that fight, the fight on the radio.

976
01:11:02,032 --> 01:11:05,470
- You're the fighter ? - Whatever gave you that idea ?

977
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:08,300
No, come on.

978
01:11:08,371 --> 01:11:10,310
You're him.

979
01:11:10,381 --> 01:11:12,810
I know you're him.

980
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:16,449
Tell me you're him.

981
01:11:16,511 --> 01:11:18,450
I'm him.

982
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,980
You killed the other boxing man.

983
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,719
He's dead ?

984
01:11:27,789 --> 01:11:30,228
The radio said he was dead.

985
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,229
Sorry about that, Floyd.

986
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:39,028
What does it feel like ?

987
01:11:39,099 --> 01:11:41,038
What does what feel like ?

988
01:11:41,109 --> 01:11:43,038
Killing a man.

989
01:11:44,808 --> 01:11:48,866
Beating another man to death with your bare hands.

990
01:11:48,948 --> 01:11:50,877
What are you, a weirdo ?

991
01:11:50,949 --> 01:11:52,878
No.

992
01:11:52,949 --> 01:11:56,387
It is a subject I have much interest in.

993
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:01,886
You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody.

994
01:12:04,398 --> 01:12:06,827
So ?

995
01:12:06,897 --> 01:12:10,155
- What does it feel like to kill a man ?

996
01:12:11,267 --> 01:12:13,196
I'll tell you what.

997
01:12:13,268 --> 01:12:17,206
Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there, and I'll tell you all about it.

998
01:12:34,926 --> 01:12:38,154
So, Esmarelda...

999
01:12:39,456 --> 01:12:42,864
Villa Lobos-- Is that Mexican ?

1000
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:46,163
The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.

1001
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:49,534
- That's some handle you got there, honey. - Thank you.

1002
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:51,535
And what is your name ?

1003
01:12:51,605 --> 01:12:53,294
Butch.

1004
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:55,844
Butch.

1005
01:12:55,904 --> 01:13:00,673
- What does it mean ? - I'm an American, honey. Our names don't mean shit.

1006
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:03,403
So, moving right along,

1007
01:13:03,485 --> 01:13:05,414
Esmarelda,

1008
01:13:05,484 --> 01:13:07,743
what is it you want to know ?

1009
01:13:07,824 --> 01:13:12,683
- I want to know what it feels like to kill a man. - I couldn't tell ya.

1010
01:13:18,593 --> 01:13:23,031
Didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead.

1011
01:13:23,103 --> 01:13:27,692
Now that I know he's dead, you wanna know how I feel about it ?

1012
01:13:31,442 --> 01:13:34,880
I don't feel the least bit bad about it.

1013
01:13:45,852 --> 01:13:48,291
What the fuck'd I tell ya ? Huh ?

1014
01:13:48,362 --> 01:13:52,290
As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man, the odds went through the roof.

1015
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,560
I know. I know. Unbelievable.

1016
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:58,069
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1017
01:13:58,132 --> 01:14:00,071
If he never laced up his gloves,

1018
01:14:00,132 --> 01:14:02,571
which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1019
01:14:04,641 --> 01:14:08,229
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck ? It's over now.

1020
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,239
Yeah, well, enough about the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1021
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:15,008
Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1022
01:14:15,081 --> 01:14:18,020
How many bookies did you lay it around on ?

1023
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:20,520
All eight ? How long to collect ?

1024
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,089
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night ? No, I understand.

1025
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:28,317
A few stragglers aside. Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1026
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:30,628
That is great news, man.

1027
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:34,897
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning.

1028
01:14:34,969 --> 01:14:38,227
It'll probably take us a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1029
01:14:38,309 --> 01:14:40,238
Okay, my brother.

1030
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,278
You're right.

1031
01:14:42,339 --> 01:14:44,678
You're goddamn right.

1032
01:14:44,749 --> 01:14:48,237
All right, Scotty, next time I see you, it'll be on Tennessee time.

1033
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:50,647
Cool, brother.

1034
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:08,226
$45.60.

1035
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:13,737
And, uh,

1036
01:15:13,807 --> 01:15:17,105
here's a little something for the effort.

1037
01:15:17,177 --> 01:15:21,105
Now, if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight, what are you gonna say ?

1038
01:15:21,177 --> 01:15:23,116
The truth.

1039
01:15:23,176 --> 01:15:26,674
Three well-dressed, slightly toasted Mexicans.

1040
01:15:28,586 --> 01:15:30,985
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1041
01:15:31,056 --> 01:15:33,575
Buenas Noches, Butch.

1042
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,635
Whew.

1043
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:49,995
Keep the light off.

1044
01:15:50,075 --> 01:15:53,004
- Is that better, Sugar Pop ? - Oui.

1045
01:15:57,484 --> 01:15:59,413
Hard day at the office ?

1046
01:15:59,484 --> 01:16:01,413
Pretty hard.

1047
01:16:01,485 --> 01:16:03,714
Got in a fight.

1048
01:16:03,784 --> 01:16:05,943
Poor baby.

1049
01:16:06,025 --> 01:16:08,584
Can you make spoons ?

1050
01:16:08,654 --> 01:16:11,593
You know what ? I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1051
01:16:11,664 --> 01:16:15,592
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here. - I like the way you stink.

1052
01:16:15,663 --> 01:16:18,092
Let me take this jacket off.

1053
01:16:20,264 --> 01:16:23,792
- I was looking at myself in the mirror. - Uh-huh.

1054
01:16:23,874 --> 01:16:25,803
I wish I had a pot.

1055
01:16:27,573 --> 01:16:31,511
You were looking at yourself in the mirror, and you wish you had some pot ?

1056
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:34,512
A pot. A pot belly.

1057
01:16:34,582 --> 01:16:36,741
Pot bellies are sexy.

1058
01:16:36,813 --> 01:16:39,112
Well, you should be happy,

1059
01:16:39,182 --> 01:16:41,121
'cause you have one.

1060
01:16:41,193 --> 01:16:44,641
Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot.

1061
01:16:44,722 --> 01:16:48,590
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."

1062
01:16:48,661 --> 01:16:50,590
It's not the same thing.

1063
01:16:50,661 --> 01:16:54,599
I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy.

1064
01:16:54,672 --> 01:16:56,601
The difference is huge.

1065
01:16:56,671 --> 01:17:00,099
Would you like it if I had a pot belly ?

1066
01:17:00,171 --> 01:17:02,110
No.

1067
01:17:02,171 --> 01:17:06,609
Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1068
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:09,768
But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.

1069
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:15,289
The rest of you is normal-- normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass--

1070
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:19,408
but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.

1071
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:22,429
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt two sizes too small...

1072
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:24,429
to accentuate it.

1073
01:17:24,499 --> 01:17:26,928
You think men would find that attractive ?

1074
01:17:26,999 --> 01:17:30,157
I don't give a damn what men find attractive.

1075
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:33,688
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.

1076
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:35,709
is seldom the same.

1077
01:17:39,109 --> 01:17:42,707
If you had a pot belly, I would punch you in it.

1078
01:17:42,779 --> 01:17:45,718
- You'd punch me in the belly ? - Right in the belly.

1079
01:17:45,778 --> 01:17:47,717
Ohh ! I'd smother you !

1080
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:51,717
- I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe !

1081
01:17:51,789 --> 01:17:53,718
- You'd do that ? - Yeah.

1082
01:17:53,788 --> 01:17:55,757
- Promise ? - Yeah.

1083
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:01,196
- Mmm. - Mmm.

1084
01:18:03,427 --> 01:18:05,866
Oh.

1085
01:18:09,307 --> 01:18:11,236
Did you get everything ?

1086
01:18:11,307 --> 01:18:14,295
- Yes, I did. - Good job, Sugar Pop.

1087
01:18:14,377 --> 01:18:16,306
Did everything go as planned ?

1088
01:18:16,377 --> 01:18:19,106
- You didn't listen to the-- Ow !

1089
01:18:19,177 --> 01:18:21,116
You didn't listen to the radio ?

1090
01:18:21,186 --> 01:18:24,474
I never listen to your fights. Were you the winner ?

1091
01:18:24,557 --> 01:18:26,846
I won, all right.

1092
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:29,885
- Are you still retiring ? - Sure am.

1093
01:18:29,956 --> 01:18:32,325
So it all worked out in the finish.

1094
01:18:33,756 --> 01:18:37,194
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1095
01:18:45,136 --> 01:18:48,005
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we ?

1096
01:18:49,575 --> 01:18:52,514
If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they ?

1097
01:18:54,585 --> 01:18:57,514
But they won't find us, will they ?

1098
01:19:00,415 --> 01:19:03,354
Do you still want me to go with you ?

1099
01:19:04,924 --> 01:19:08,582
I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance. It's--

1100
01:19:15,203 --> 01:19:17,562
Say it.

1101
01:19:17,634 --> 01:19:20,233
- Fabienne,

1102
01:19:20,303 --> 01:19:23,431
I want you to be with me.

1103
01:19:23,503 --> 01:19:26,501
- Forever ? - Forever and ever.

1104
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:30,611
Do you love me ?

1105
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,672
Very, very much.

1106
01:19:38,392 --> 01:19:40,951
- Butch. - Yes ?

1107
01:19:42,392 --> 01:19:44,981
Will you give me oral pleasure ?

1108
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:48,430
Will you kiss it ?

1109
01:19:50,361 --> 01:19:52,560
But you first.

1110
01:19:52,632 --> 01:19:55,471
- Okay. - Okay.

1111
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:07,980
Butch.

1112
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:11,478
Mon amour. L'aventure commence.

1113
01:20:27,139 --> 01:20:29,578
I think I cracked a rib.

1114
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:33,078
- Giving me oral pleasure ? - No, retard, from the fight.

1115
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:36,578
- Don't call me "retard." -  My name is Fabby.

1116
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:39,138
- My name is Fabienne ! - Stop it.

1117
01:20:39,219 --> 01:20:41,148
- Stop it ! - My name is Fabi--

1118
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:44,158
Shut up, fuckhead ! I hate that mongoloid voice.

1119
01:20:44,228 --> 01:20:47,316
Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1120
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:50,328
- I take it back.

1121
01:20:52,328 --> 01:20:55,267
Will you hand me a dry towel, Miss Beautiful Tulip ?

1122
01:20:55,338 --> 01:20:59,266
- Oh, I like that. I like being called a tulip.

1123
01:20:59,338 --> 01:21:01,767
"Tulip" is much better than "mongoloid."

1124
01:21:01,837 --> 01:21:04,776
I didn't call you a mongoloid. I called you a retard.

1125
01:21:04,848 --> 01:21:06,967
And I took it back.

1126
01:21:07,047 --> 01:21:09,136
- Butch ?

1127
01:21:09,218 --> 01:21:11,147
Yes, Lemon Pie ?

1128
01:21:11,217 --> 01:21:14,645
- Where are we going to go ? - Well, I'm not sure yet.

1129
01:21:14,717 --> 01:21:16,846
Wherever you want.

1130
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:19,856
We're gonna get a lot of money from this,

1131
01:21:19,926 --> 01:21:22,855
but it ain't gonna be the kind of money...

1132
01:21:22,927 --> 01:21:25,866
that we can live like hogs in the fathouse forever.

1133
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:29,865
I was thinking maybe we could go down someplace in the South Pacific.

1134
01:21:29,936 --> 01:21:33,364
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna carry us a long way down there.

1135
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:36,374
- If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora ? - You betcha.

1136
01:21:36,435 --> 01:21:39,873
And if after a while you didn't dig that, we could go someplace else.

1137
01:21:39,946 --> 01:21:41,875
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1138
01:21:41,946 --> 01:21:43,875
But I do not speak Spanish.

1139
01:21:43,946 --> 01:21:46,915
Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.

1140
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:48,954
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1141
01:21:49,015 --> 01:21:51,954
- Â¿ Donde esta el zapateria ? - What does that mean ?

1142
01:21:52,024 --> 01:21:53,953
Where is the shoe store?

1143
01:21:54,024 --> 01:21:55,953
- Â¿ Donde esta-- - Spit, please.

1144
01:21:58,025 --> 01:22:01,293
- Â¿ Donde esta el zapateria ? - Excellent pronunciation.

1145
01:22:01,364 --> 01:22:03,383
- Mmm.

1146
01:22:03,464 --> 01:22:06,762
You'll be my little mamacita in no time.

1147
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:09,363
-  Â¿ Que hora es ? - Â¿ Que hora es ?

1148
01:22:09,433 --> 01:22:11,592
- What time is it ? - What time is it ?

1149
01:22:11,674 --> 01:22:14,303
Time for bed.

1150
01:22:14,373 --> 01:22:16,312
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1151
01:22:24,023 --> 01:22:25,952
Butch ?

1152
01:22:31,862 --> 01:22:33,791
Never mind.

1153
01:22:40,772 --> 01:22:43,391
Aah !

1154
01:22:43,472 --> 01:22:47,530
Merde ! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream ?

1155
01:22:57,981 --> 01:23:02,249
- What is this you're watching ? - A motorcycle movie.

1156
01:23:02,321 --> 01:23:04,250
I'm not sure the name.

1157
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,248
- Are you watching it ? - In a way.

1158
01:23:11,061 --> 01:23:15,159
It's a little early in the morning for explosions and war.

1159
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,438
- What was it about ? - How should I know ? You were the one watching it.

1160
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:26,498
- No, imbecile, what was your dream about ? - I don't know.

1161
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,509
I don't remember.

1162
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:31,509
It's really rare that I remember my dreams.

1163
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:34,549
Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning.

1164
01:23:36,619 --> 01:23:39,558
Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast.

1165
01:23:39,619 --> 01:23:42,248
One more kiss, and I'll get up.

1166
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:47,627
- Satisfied ? - Yep.

1167
01:23:47,698 --> 01:23:51,126
-  Get up, lazy bones ! - Ohh !

1168
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:54,256
- Ohh. God.

1169
01:23:55,568 --> 01:23:59,096
- What time is it ? - Almost nine in the morning.

1170
01:23:59,177 --> 01:24:02,935
- What time does our train arrive ? - Eleven.

1171
01:24:03,008 --> 01:24:07,376
- You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast ? - What, Lemon Pie ?

1172
01:24:07,448 --> 01:24:11,576
I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes...

1173
01:24:11,657 --> 01:24:13,586
with maple syrup,

1174
01:24:13,657 --> 01:24:17,085
eggs over easy and five sausages.

1175
01:24:17,156 --> 01:24:19,355
Anything to drink with that ?

1176
01:24:19,426 --> 01:24:23,084
Wow, that looks nice.

1177
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:26,494
To drink-- A tall glass of orange juice...

1178
01:24:26,566 --> 01:24:28,995
and a black cup of coffee.

1179
01:24:29,066 --> 01:24:33,635
- After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie. - Pie for breakfast ?

1180
01:24:33,706 --> 01:24:37,644
- Any time of the day is a good time for pie.

1181
01:24:37,716 --> 01:24:40,645
Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.

1182
01:24:40,715 --> 01:24:43,703
And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.

1183
01:24:43,785 --> 01:24:45,714
Where's my watch ?

1184
01:24:50,184 --> 01:24:52,453
It's there.

1185
01:24:52,524 --> 01:24:55,113
- No, it's not. - Have you looked ?

1186
01:24:55,194 --> 01:24:59,462
Yes, I've fuckin' looked. What the fuck do you think I'm doin' ?

1187
01:24:59,534 --> 01:25:01,653
You sure you got it ?

1188
01:25:01,734 --> 01:25:04,033
Yes. Bedside table drawer.

1189
01:25:04,104 --> 01:25:07,262
- On the little kangaroo ? - Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1190
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:10,501
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1191
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:13,442
- Well, it should be.

1192
01:25:13,514 --> 01:25:17,312
Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's not here now ! So where the fuck is it ?

1193
01:25:22,883 --> 01:25:26,321
Fabienne, where's my father's fucking watch ?

1194
01:25:27,993 --> 01:25:32,431
Do you have any idea what he had to go through to get me that watch ?

1195
01:25:32,493 --> 01:25:35,432
I don't have time to go into it, but he went through a lot.

1196
01:25:35,503 --> 01:25:40,832
All this other shit you could've set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget the fucking watch.

1197
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:42,231
Now think.

1198
01:25:42,302 --> 01:25:45,830
- Did you get it ? - I believe so.

1199
01:25:45,911 --> 01:25:49,169
"You believe so" ? What the fuck does that mean ? You either did or didn't get it.

1200
01:25:50,582 --> 01:25:52,511
Then I did.

1201
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:55,821
Are you sure ?

1202
01:25:56,921 --> 01:25:58,850
No.

1203
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,889
Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck !

1204
01:26:02,961 --> 01:26:05,320
Motherfucker ! Motherfuckin'--

1205
01:26:07,231 --> 01:26:10,030
Do you know how fucking stupid you fucking are ?

1206
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,029
No !

1207
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,599
It's not your fault.

1208
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:23,839
You left it at the apartment.

1209
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:32,848
If you left it at the apartment, it's not your fault.

1210
01:26:34,919 --> 01:26:38,047
I had you bring a bunch of stuff.

1211
01:26:40,258 --> 01:26:42,197
I reminded you about it,

1212
01:26:42,258 --> 01:26:47,027
but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me.

1213
01:26:47,099 --> 01:26:51,127
If all I gave a fuck about was the watch, I shoulda told you that.

1214
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:53,637
You're not a mind reader.

1215
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:55,637
Are you ?

1216
01:27:05,788 --> 01:27:07,717
I-- I'm sorry.

1217
01:27:07,787 --> 01:27:11,375
Don't be. Just means I can't have breakfast with you.

1218
01:27:11,457 --> 01:27:14,146
Why does it mean that ?

1219
01:27:16,726 --> 01:27:20,054
Because I gotta go back to my apartment and get my watch.

1220
01:27:21,266 --> 01:27:23,785
Won't the gangsters be looking for you there ?

1221
01:27:23,867 --> 01:27:28,135
Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.

1222
01:27:28,206 --> 01:27:31,434
If they are, and I don't think I can handle it,

1223
01:27:31,506 --> 01:27:33,445
then I'll split.

1224
01:27:33,505 --> 01:27:37,803
I saw your watch. I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1225
01:27:43,085 --> 01:27:46,143
Here's some money. Go out and get those pancakes.

1226
01:27:46,225 --> 01:27:48,084
Have a nice breakfast.

1227
01:27:48,154 --> 01:27:51,592
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back before you can say "blueberry pie."

1228
01:27:51,664 --> 01:27:54,093
Blueberry pie.

1229
01:27:54,165 --> 01:27:56,324
Maybe not that fast.

1230
01:27:56,395 --> 01:27:59,593
- But pretty fast. Okay ? - Okay.

1231
01:27:59,665 --> 01:28:02,004
- Bye. - Bye.

1232
01:28:02,074 --> 01:28:05,003
Shit ! Of all the fuckin' things she could fuckin' forget,

1233
01:28:05,074 --> 01:28:07,003
she forgets my father's watch !

1234
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:09,012
I specifically reminded her--

1235
01:28:09,073 --> 01:28:11,202
bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1236
01:28:11,283 --> 01:28:14,541
I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch."

1237
01:28:30,033 --> 01:28:33,461
Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...

1238
01:28:43,612 --> 01:28:47,770
EI burro !

1239
01:30:51,444 --> 01:30:53,373
Lookin' good, Butch.

1240
01:33:42,465 --> 01:33:44,524
lf I were walkin' in your shoes

1241
01:33:52,075 --> 01:33:57,514
Countin' flowers on the wall That don't bother me at all

1242
01:33:57,584 --> 01:34:02,022
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty-one

1243
01:34:04,094 --> 01:34:06,023
That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch.

1244
01:34:05,094 --> 01:34:08,322
-  Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo

1245
01:34:07,093 --> 01:34:09,092
- They keep underestimatin' ya.

1246
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:10,322
Now don't tell me

1247
01:34:11,893 --> 01:34:15,351
Countin' flowers on the wall

1248
01:34:15,433 --> 01:34:18,891
That don't bother me at all

1249
01:34:18,973 --> 01:34:24,502
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty-one

1250
01:34:24,572 --> 01:34:29,311
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo

1251
01:34:29,382 --> 01:34:32,281

Do you think he's dead ? - He's dead.

01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,669
- Oh, my God. - He's dead.

1261
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:12,478
If you need someone to go to court, I'll be glad to help. That guy was a drunken maniac.

1262
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:15,489
He hit you, then he crashed into that car.

1263
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,489
- Who ? - Him.

1264
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,759

01:36:15,547 --> 01:36:18,446
- You feel that sting, huh, big boy ?

That's pride fuckin' with you, see ?

- You'd better kill me-- - Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.

- Hold it right there, goddamn it.

1280

01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:38,895
- Toss the weapon. - You don't understand, man.

1282
01:36:38,965 --> 01:36:40,994
Toss the weapon.

1283
01:36:46,304 --> 01:36:49,003

Zed. Maynard.

1292
01:37:28,182 --> 01:37:31,111
Yeah, the spider just caught a couple flies.

1293
01:37:31,182 --> 01:37:34,620
Whoa, my angel

1294
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:39,890
Down to you

1295
01:37:39,891 --> 01:37:40,320
Down to you

1296
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:21,889
Nobody kills anybody in my place of business...

1297
01:38:21,949 --> 01:38:24,888
- except me or Zed.

1298
01:38:27,159 --> 01:38:29,088
That's Zed.

1299
01:38:41,739 --> 01:38:45,177
-  I thought you said you waited for me. -  I did.

1300
01:38:49,478 --> 01:38:52,417
Then how come they're all beat up ?

1301
01:38:52,477 --> 01:38:56,745
They did that to each other, man. They came in fightin'.

1302
01:38:56,818 --> 01:39:01,156
Now, this 'un right here, he was gonna shoot that one.

1303
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:04,585
Is that right ? You gonna shoot him, boy ?

1304
01:39:04,657 --> 01:39:07,256
Huh ?

1305
01:39:09,266 --> 01:39:12,324
Hey, is Grace all right out front ?

1306
01:39:12,397 --> 01:39:15,625
- Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it ? - No, it's Thursday.

1307
01:39:15,706 --> 01:39:18,295
- She oughta be fine. - Mmm.

1308
01:39:19,776 --> 01:39:24,034
Well, bring out the Gimp.

1309
01:39:25,146 --> 01:39:27,875
I think the Gimp's sleepin'.

1310
01:39:27,945 --> 01:39:31,883
Then I guess you'll just have to go wake him up now, won't you ?

1311
01:40:10,994 --> 01:40:12,923
Get up.

1312
01:40:26,202 --> 01:40:28,141
Get down.

1313
01:40:38,211 --> 01:40:41,150
Which one of 'em you wanna do first ?

1314
01:40:41,222 --> 01:40:44,950
- I ain't for sure yet.

1315
01:40:48,491 --> 01:40:51,150
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo,

01:40:51,231 --> 01:40:53,820

1317
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:56,489
by his toe.

1318
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:00,328
If he hollers, let him go.

1319
01:41:00,401 --> 01:41:04,529
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1320
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:10,439
My mother said...

1321
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:14,108
pick the perfect one,

1322
01:41:14,179 --> 01:41:17,167
and... you... are...

1323
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:20,549
it.

1324
01:41:22,889 --> 01:41:25,947
-Guess that means you, big boy. - Fuck you !

1325
01:41:26,029 --> 01:41:28,498
- Shh.

1326
01:41:30,299 --> 01:41:34,858
- You wanna do it in here ? - No, let's take him back to Russell's old room.

1327
01:41:34,939 --> 01:41:37,668
Sounds good to me.

1328
01:42:01,597 --> 01:42:04,685
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1329
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:35,114
Yeah !

1330
01:42:37,695 --> 01:42:40,893
Now ! Go ! Come on, motherfucker !

01:42:40,964 --> 01:42:44,402

01:43:09,494 --> 01:43:12,922
- Yeah ! Yeah !

01:43:14,433 --> 01:43:17,362
Yeee ! Yeeee-hah !

1336
01:43:38,021 --> 01:43:39,950
Yeah !

1337
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:11,348
Come on ! Get down there !

1338
01:44:13,989 --> 01:44:17,217
Aaah ! Do it ! Yeah !

1339
01:44:34,339 --> 01:44:37,327
Yeah ! Yeah !

1340
01:44:52,518 --> 01:44:55,956
- Shut the fuck up !

1341
01:44:57,727 --> 01:44:59,656
Fuck him !

1342
01:45:01,827 --> 01:45:03,766
Come on !

1343
01:45:07,366 --> 01:45:10,804
- - Fuck him. Yeah.

1344
01:45:20,915 --> 01:45:23,424
Aaaaah !

1345
01:45:27,966 --> 01:45:30,525
- Aaaaah !

1346
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:43,773
You want that gun, don't ya, Zed ?

1347
01:45:45,445 --> 01:45:47,384
Huh ?

1348
01:45:48,384 --> 01:45:50,313
Go ahead and pick it up.

1349
01:45:52,724 --> 01:45:55,053
Go ahead. Pick it up.

1350
01:45:57,323 --> 01:45:59,812
Come on-- Thatta boy !

1351
01:46:01,393 --> 01:46:05,491
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1352
01:46:09,733 --> 01:46:12,791
- Step aside, Butch.

1353
01:46:25,053 --> 01:46:28,081
Fuck !

1354
01:46:30,692 --> 01:46:33,621
- You okay ?

1355
01:46:34,991 --> 01:46:37,150
No, man.

1356
01:46:37,231 --> 01:46:40,160
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1357
01:46:51,341 --> 01:46:54,280
- What now ?

1358
01:46:56,611 --> 01:46:58,550
"What now" ?

1359
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:03,348
- Let me tell you what now.

1360
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:06,359
I'm gonna call a couple of hard, pipe-hittin' niggers...

1361
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,359
to go to work on the homes here...

1362
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:12,359
with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.

1363
01:47:14,330 --> 01:47:17,029
You hear me talkin', hillbilly boy ?

1364
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:20,859
I ain't through with you by a damn sight !

1365
01:47:20,939 --> 01:47:23,868
I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.

1366
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:30,078
I meant what now between me and you.

1367
01:47:35,148 --> 01:47:37,547
Oh, that "what now."

1368
01:47:38,988 --> 01:47:42,926
- I tell you what now between me and you.

1369
01:47:44,497 --> 01:47:47,426
There is no me and you.

1370
01:47:48,867 --> 01:47:50,796
Not no more.

1371
01:47:53,868 --> 01:47:55,807
So, are we cool ?

1372
01:47:57,177 --> 01:47:59,466
Yeah, we cool.

1373
01:47:59,537 --> 01:48:01,666
- Two things.

1374
01:48:03,447 --> 01:48:06,376
Don't tell nobody about this.

1375
01:48:07,847 --> 01:48:11,475
This shit is between me, you...

1376
01:48:11,557 --> 01:48:16,015
and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin' The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass- Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain"...

1377
01:48:16,086 --> 01:48:18,025
rapist here.

1378
01:48:19,325 --> 01:48:22,084
It ain't nobody else's business.

1379
01:48:22,165 --> 01:48:24,094
Two:

1380
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:27,653
You leave town tonight. Right now.

1381
01:48:28,905 --> 01:48:30,834
And when you gone,

1382
01:48:30,905 --> 01:48:32,834
you stay gone,

1383
01:48:32,905 --> 01:48:35,844
- or you be gone.

1384
01:48:35,905 --> 01:48:38,844
You lost all your L.A. privileges. Deal ?

1385
01:48:40,684 --> 01:48:42,613
Deal.

1386
01:48:43,855 --> 01:48:45,784
Get your ass outta here.

1387
01:49:12,243 --> 01:49:14,492
Oh, shit.

1388
01:49:47,491 --> 01:49:49,920
Fabienne !

1389
01:49:50,991 --> 01:49:53,930
Fabienne !

1390
01:49:55,161 --> 01:49:57,260
Fabienne ! Come on, baby.

1391
01:49:57,330 --> 01:50:00,768
- Come on. Get your shit. We gotta go right now. - I was so worried.

1392
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:04,268
- What about our bags ? - Fuck the bags; if we don't split right now, we'll miss the train.

1393
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:06,269
- I'll be downstairs. - Is everything well ?

1394
01:50:06,339 --> 01:50:10,277
- Just come on ! No talking now ! - Are we in danger ?

1395
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:15,719
Come on, honey !

1396
01:50:17,790 --> 01:50:20,259
Where did you get this motorcycle ?

1397
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:24,848
- It's not a motorcycle, baby. It's a chopper. Let's go. - What happened to my Honda ?

1398
01:50:24,928 --> 01:50:28,686
I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that Honda. Will you come on now, please ?

1399
01:50:28,758 --> 01:50:31,157
Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1400
01:50:35,738 --> 01:50:39,166
- You're hurt ? - No, no, I might've broken my nose. It's no biggie.

1401
01:50:39,238 --> 01:50:42,177
Come on. Hop on. Baby, please, we--

1402
01:50:42,247 --> 01:50:45,176
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road ! Get on !

1403
01:50:46,847 --> 01:50:50,285
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Come here, come here.

1404
01:50:50,348 --> 01:50:52,287
I'm sorry. Mmm.

1405
01:50:52,358 --> 01:50:56,286
- I'm so sorry. - You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.

1406
01:50:56,357 --> 01:50:59,286
I didn't mean to worry you. Everything's fine.

1407
01:50:59,357 --> 01:51:01,296
- How was your breakfast ? - It was good.

1408
01:51:01,357 --> 01:51:03,296
Did you get the blueberry pancakes ?

1409
01:51:03,366 --> 01:51:07,294
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay ?

1410
01:51:07,367 --> 01:51:10,306
Since I left you, this has been, without a doubt,

1411
01:51:10,367 --> 01:51:13,595
the single weirdest fuckin' day of my life-- I'll tell you all about it.

1412
01:51:13,676 --> 01:51:15,535
Gotta go. Come on.

1413
01:51:15,606 --> 01:51:18,375
Butch, whose motorcycle is this ?

1414
01:51:18,445 --> 01:51:21,034
- It's a chopper, baby. - Whose chopper is this ?

1415
01:51:21,115 --> 01:51:23,044
- Zed's. - Who's Zed ?

1416
01:51:23,115 --> 01:51:25,674
Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.

1417
01:51:41,865 --> 01:51:44,164
Yes, you did, Brett !

1418
01:51:44,234 --> 01:51:47,762
You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked...

1419
01:51:47,834 --> 01:51:50,273
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1420
01:51:50,344 --> 01:51:53,432
- Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die. - You read the Bible, Brett ?

1421
01:51:53,513 --> 01:51:56,941
-  Yes ! - Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

1422
01:51:57,013 --> 01:51:59,172
Sorta fits the occasion.

1423
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:02,542
Ezekiel 25:17.

1424
01:52:02,623 --> 01:52:06,921
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides...

1425
01:52:06,993 --> 01:52:08,922
by the inequities of the selfish...

1426
01:52:08,993 --> 01:52:12,421
- and the tyranny of evil men.

1427
01:52:12,493 --> 01:52:17,162
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will,

1428
01:52:17,233 --> 01:52:20,261
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,

1429
01:52:20,332 --> 01:52:22,861
for he is truly his brother's keeper...

1430
01:52:22,942 --> 01:52:25,671
and the finder of lost children.

1431
01:52:25,742 --> 01:52:30,000
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance...

1432
01:52:30,081 --> 01:52:32,240
and furious anger...

1433
01:52:32,311 --> 01:52:36,709
those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.

1434
01:52:36,782 --> 01:52:40,650
And you will know My name is the Lord...

1435
01:52:40,721 --> 01:52:44,119
when I lay My vengeance upon thee."

1436
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,629
I'm fucked. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1437
01:52:54,701 --> 01:52:57,640
-  ls he a friend of yours ? - Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1438
01:52:57,701 --> 01:53:00,640
Hmm ? Oh. Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1439
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:03,639
- Better tell him to shut up. He's gettin' on my nerves. - Fuck.

1440
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:06,908
Marvin. Marvin ! I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1441
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:11,138
- Die, you motherfuckers ! Die !

1442
01:53:39,308 --> 01:53:42,746
Why the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom ?

1443
01:53:42,818 --> 01:53:45,677
Slip your mind ? Did you forget that someone was in there...

1444
01:53:45,747 --> 01:53:47,686
with a goddamn hand cannon ?

1445
01:53:47,748 --> 01:53:51,686
You see the size of that gun he fired at us ? It was bigger than him.

1446
01:53:56,457 --> 01:53:59,156
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1447
01:53:59,226 --> 01:54:01,165
I know. We was lucky.

1448
01:54:01,226 --> 01:54:04,354
No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.

1449
01:54:04,437 --> 01:54:08,635
- Yeah, maybe. - This was divine intervention.

1450
01:54:08,707 --> 01:54:10,636
You know what divine intervention is ?

1451
01:54:16,515 --> 01:54:18,444
I think so.

1452
01:54:18,516 --> 01:54:21,944
That means that God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.

1453
01:54:22,016 --> 01:54:24,455
That's right. That's exactly what it means.

1454
01:54:24,516 --> 01:54:27,485
God came down from Heaven and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1455
01:54:28,725 --> 01:54:30,714
I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.

1456
01:54:30,795 --> 01:54:33,224
Don't do that. Don't fuckin' blow this shit off !

1457
01:54:33,295 --> 01:54:37,233
- What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle ! - Chill. This shit happens.

1458
01:54:37,294 --> 01:54:40,063
Wrong ! Wrong. This shit doesn't "just happen."

1459
01:54:40,135 --> 01:54:43,573
Do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car...

1460
01:54:43,634 --> 01:54:46,073
or in a jailhouse with the cops ?

1461
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:48,763
We should be fuckin' dead, my friend !

1462
01:54:48,844 --> 01:54:53,072
What happened here was a miracle, and I want you to fucking acknowledge it !

1463
01:54:53,144 --> 01:54:57,843
All right, it was a miracle. Can we go now ?

1464
01:55:04,853 --> 01:55:08,221
Let's go, nigger ! Come on ! Shit.

1465
01:55:10,102 --> 01:55:11,901
You ever seen that show Cops ?

1466
01:55:11,973 --> 01:55:14,902
I was watching it one time, and there was this cop on,

1467
01:55:14,972 --> 01:55:18,910
and he was talkin' about this gunfight he had in the hallway with this guy, right ?

1468
01:55:18,982 --> 01:55:22,430
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin' happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1469
01:55:22,512 --> 01:55:25,451
Okay ? It was just him and this guy.

1470
01:55:25,522 --> 01:55:28,850
I mean, you know, it's, it's freaky, but it happens.

1471
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:33,861
You wanna play blind man, go walk with the shepherd, but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1472
01:55:33,922 --> 01:55:36,861
- What the fuck does that mean ? - It means that's it for me.

1473
01:55:36,931 --> 01:55:39,620
From here on in, you can consider my ass retired.

1474
01:55:39,701 --> 01:55:41,860
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it. - Don't blaspheme.

1475
01:55:41,931 --> 01:55:44,989
- I said, don't do that ! - Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us ?

1476
01:55:45,070 --> 01:55:48,128
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today-- I'm through.

1477
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:51,139
- Why don't you tell him at the same time why ? - Don't worry, I will.

1478
01:55:51,211 --> 01:55:55,199
- And I bet you $10,000
he laughs his ass off. - I don't give a damn if he does.

1479
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:58,368
Marvin, what do you make of all this ?

1480
01:55:58,450 --> 01:56:00,879
Man, I don't even have an opinion.

1481
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:05,178
You gotta have an opinion. You think God came down from Heaven and stopped--

1482
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:07,249
- What the fuck's happenin' ?

1483
01:56:07,319 --> 01:56:09,258
- Aw, shit, man ! - Aw, man !

1484
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:12,259
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face. - Why the fuck'd you do that ?

1485
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:13,559
I didn't mean it. It was an accident.

1486
01:56:13,630 --> 01:56:16,569
- Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in my time, but this-- - Chill out, man !

1487
01:56:16,629 --> 01:56:19,568
It was an accident. We probably went over a bump or somethin'.

1488
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:21,568
The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.

1489
01:56:21,638 --> 01:56:24,966
I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1490
01:56:25,038 --> 01:56:28,476
Look at this fuckin' mess ! We're on a city street in broad daylight here !

1491
01:56:28,549 --> 01:56:31,478
- I don't believe it ! - Well, believe it now, motherfucker !

1492
01:56:31,549 --> 01:56:35,007
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1493
01:56:34,588 --> 01:56:37,517
- Just take it to a friendly place, that's all ! - This is the Valley, Vincent.

1494
01:56:37,588 --> 01:56:40,017
Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley.

1495
01:56:40,088 --> 01:56:43,027
- Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man ! - Shit !

1496
01:56:43,097 --> 01:56:46,026
- What you doing ? - I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1497
01:56:46,098 --> 01:56:49,626
-Where's Toluca Lake ? -Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1498
01:56:49,698 --> 01:56:52,637
If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,

1499
01:56:52,697 --> 01:56:55,636
'cause I ain't got no other partners in 818.

1500
01:56:55,707 --> 01:56:58,636
Jimmie, how you doin', man ? It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1501
01:56:58,707 --> 01:57:02,645
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1502
01:57:02,707 --> 01:57:04,906
I need to use your garage for a couple hours.

1503
01:57:06,917 --> 01:57:09,846
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation.

1504
01:57:09,916 --> 01:57:13,544
He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.

1505
01:57:13,626 --> 01:57:16,555
- If he does, what do we do ? - We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls,

1506
01:57:16,626 --> 01:57:19,555
but I don't want it to reach that pitch-- Jimmie's a friend.

1507
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:22,564
You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what.

1508
01:57:22,626 --> 01:57:24,565
Just tell him not to be abusive.

1509
01:57:24,636 --> 01:57:26,565
He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.

1510
01:57:26,635 --> 01:57:29,793
Put yourself in his position-- It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

1511
01:57:29,865 --> 01:57:31,804
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1512
01:57:31,875 --> 01:57:34,804
We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor.

1513
01:57:34,875 --> 01:57:38,813
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass.

1514
01:57:39,175 --> 01:57:43,113
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man ? - I was dryin' my hands !

1515
01:57:43,185 --> 01:57:46,114
- You're supposed to wash 'em first ! - You watched me wash 'em.

1516
01:57:46,184 --> 01:57:49,742
- I watched you get 'em wet. - I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.

1517
01:57:49,823 --> 01:57:51,752
Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job.

1518
01:57:51,824 --> 01:57:53,753
I used the same fuckin' soap you did,

1519
01:57:53,823 --> 01:57:56,762
and when I finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad !

1520
01:57:56,824 --> 01:57:59,763
What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this ?

1521
01:57:59,833 --> 01:58:03,921
It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head, man !

1522
01:58:04,003 --> 01:58:07,431
Look, I ain't threatenin' you or nothin', all right ?

1523
01:58:07,503 --> 01:58:11,961
You know I respect you and all. But just don't put me in this position, all right ?

1524
01:58:12,042 --> 01:58:14,741
All right. Fine. Fine.

1525
01:58:14,813 --> 01:58:17,742
Ask me nice like that, no problem.

1526
01:58:17,812 --> 01:58:20,751
Just go handle your friend. Go ahead. I don't care.

1527
01:58:22,482 --> 01:58:25,351
Mmm ! Goddamn, Jimmie !

1528
01:58:25,422 --> 01:58:27,511
This some serious gourmet shit.

1529
01:58:27,592 --> 01:58:29,521
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied...

1530
01:58:29,591 --> 01:58:31,560
with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.

1531
01:58:31,632 --> 01:58:33,561
Right ?

1532
01:58:33,632 --> 01:58:36,561
And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.

1533
01:58:36,632 --> 01:58:38,691
- What flavor is this ? - Knock it off, Julie.

1534
01:58:38,771 --> 01:58:42,789
- What ? - I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1535
01:58:42,871 --> 01:58:45,360
I'm the one who buys it. I know how good it is.

1536
01:58:45,441 --> 01:58:47,370
When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.

1537
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:51,068
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1538
01:58:51,151 --> 01:58:55,079
But you know what's on my mind right now ? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1539
01:58:55,151 --> 01:58:57,310
It's the dead nigger in my garage.

1540
01:58:57,390 --> 01:59:00,818
- Jimmie, don't even worry-- - Don't tell me about anything. I wanna ask you a question.

1541
01:59:00,890 --> 01:59:02,819
When you came pulling in here,

1542
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:06,088
did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage" ?

1543
01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:09,597
- You know I ain't seen no-- - Did you notice the sign on the front of my house...

1544
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:11,599
that said, "Dead Nigger Storage" ?

1545
01:59:11,670 --> 01:59:14,399
No. I didn't.

1546
01:59:14,469 --> 01:59:17,398
- You know why you didn't see that sign ? - Why ?

1547
01:59:17,469 --> 01:59:21,998
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why !

1548
01:59:22,078 --> 01:59:25,007
- We're not gonna store the motherfucker-- - Don't you fuckin' realize...

1549
01:59:25,079 --> 01:59:29,517
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced ?

1550
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:32,817
No marriage counselor. No trial separation. I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1551
01:59:32,888 --> 01:59:36,246
Okay ? And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced !

1552
01:59:36,318 --> 01:59:41,317
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you, but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1553
01:59:41,397 --> 01:59:43,486
Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you.

1554
01:59:43,558 --> 01:59:47,496
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules ! Okay ? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1555
01:59:47,568 --> 01:59:51,526
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Is there ?

1556
01:59:54,677 --> 01:59:59,336
Now, look, you know, she comes home from work in about an hour and a half.

1557
01:59:59,406 --> 02:00:02,464
The graveyard shift at the hospital.

1558
02:00:02,547 --> 02:00:05,605
You gotta make some phone calls ? You gotta call some people ?

1559
02:00:05,687 --> 02:00:09,615
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here.

1560
02:00:09,686 --> 02:00:12,625
That's Kool and the Gang. We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1561
02:00:12,685 --> 02:00:15,654
All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in.

1562
02:00:15,725 --> 02:00:18,664
You're fucking my shit up right now !

1563
02:00:18,726 --> 02:00:21,824
You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home.

1564
02:00:21,895 --> 02:00:25,393
Do me that favor, all right ? The phone is in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1565
02:00:25,465 --> 02:00:28,404
Well, say she comes home.

1566
02:00:28,475 --> 02:00:30,904
What do you think she'll do ?

1567
02:00:32,405 --> 02:00:34,844
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1568
02:00:34,914 --> 02:00:37,103
That ain't no kinda answer.

1569
02:00:37,175 --> 02:00:40,233
I mean, you know, I don't. How much ? A lot or a little ?

1570
02:00:40,314 --> 02:00:43,183
You got to appreciate what an explosive element...

1571
02:00:43,254 --> 02:00:45,183
this Bonnie situation is.

1572
02:00:45,254 --> 02:00:49,192
She comes home from a hard day's work, finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...

1573
02:00:49,253 --> 02:00:51,192
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

1574
02:00:51,263 --> 02:00:54,321
there ain't no tellin' what she's liable to do.

1575
02:00:56,494 --> 02:00:58,433
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1576
02:00:58,503 --> 02:01:01,092
All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.

1577
02:01:01,173 --> 02:01:04,102
I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs !

1578
02:01:04,173 --> 02:01:08,101
All I want to hear from your ass is, "You ain't got no problem, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.

1579
02:01:08,173 --> 02:01:12,341
Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly."

1580
02:01:12,413 --> 02:01:15,571
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1581
02:01:15,652 --> 02:01:17,771
I'm on the motherfucker.

1582
02:01:17,853 --> 02:01:22,912
Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1583
02:01:22,992 --> 02:01:25,421
You sendin' the Wolf ?

1584
02:01:25,492 --> 02:01:27,681
Oh, you feel better, motherfucker ?

1585
02:01:27,761 --> 02:01:30,020
Shit, yeah, negro !

1586
02:01:30,092 --> 02:01:33,220
That's all you had to say !

1587
02:01:33,301 --> 02:01:36,489
- She the hysterical type ?

1588
02:01:36,571 --> 02:01:39,500
- When is she due ?

1589
02:01:39,571 --> 02:01:41,660
Mm-hmm.

1590
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:43,669
Give me the principals' names again.

1591
02:01:43,741 --> 02:01:45,680
Place your bets.

1592
02:01:46,740 --> 02:01:50,408
- Jules. Mm-hmm. - Cards, please.

1593
02:01:50,481 --> 02:01:52,420
Vincent.

1594
02:01:57,150 --> 02:01:59,089
Jimmie.

1595
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:02,448
Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1596
02:02:07,870 --> 02:02:10,958
It's thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten.

1597
02:02:27,778 --> 02:02:30,707
You're... Jimmie, right ? This is your house ?

1598
02:02:30,778 --> 02:02:34,406
- It sure is. - I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1599
02:02:34,488 --> 02:02:37,417
- Good. We got one. - So I heard. May I come in ?

1600
02:02:37,488 --> 02:02:39,417
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1601
02:02:39,487 --> 02:02:43,145
You must be Jules. Which would make you... Vincent.

1602
02:02:43,228 --> 02:02:45,657
Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1603
02:02:45,728 --> 02:02:48,667
If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie ?

1604
02:02:48,727 --> 02:02:50,666
Uh, one hundred percent.

1605
02:02:50,737 --> 02:02:54,665
- Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., correct ? - Uh-huh.

1606
02:02:54,737 --> 02:02:59,226
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1607
02:02:59,307 --> 02:03:03,605
- She wouldn't at that. - That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1608
02:03:03,677 --> 02:03:07,115
which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty.

1609
02:03:07,186 --> 02:03:11,514
Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1610
02:03:19,256 --> 02:03:21,195
- Jimmie. - Uh-huh.

1611
02:03:21,265 --> 02:03:24,693
Do me a favor, will ya ? Thought I smelled some coffee back there.

1612
02:03:24,765 --> 02:03:28,203
- Would you make me a cup ? - Uh, yeah, sure.

1613
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:32,603
Oh, uh, um, how do you take it ?

1614
02:03:32,674 --> 02:03:35,233
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1615
02:03:37,315 --> 02:03:40,743
About the car, is there anything I need to know ? Does it stall ?

1616
02:03:40,814 --> 02:03:44,252
Does it smoke ? Does it make a lot of noise ? ls there gas in it ?

1617
02:03:44,314 --> 02:03:47,752
- Aside from how it looks, the car's cool. - Positive ?

1618
02:03:47,823 --> 02:03:51,251
Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.

1619
02:03:51,323 --> 02:03:55,381
- As far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top. - Good enough.

1620
02:03:55,464 --> 02:03:57,483
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1621
02:04:03,133 --> 02:04:06,072
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf. - Thank you, Jimmie.

1622
02:04:10,913 --> 02:04:12,842
Mmm.

1623
02:04:13,912 --> 02:04:16,041
Okay, first thing. You two.

1624
02:04:16,113 --> 02:04:19,052
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.

1625
02:04:19,112 --> 02:04:21,841
This looks to be a pretty domesticated house.

1626
02:04:21,922 --> 02:04:25,850
- That would lead me to believe you got cleansers and shit. - Yeah. Under the sink.

1627
02:04:25,921 --> 02:04:29,359
Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products...

1628
02:04:29,422 --> 02:04:33,450
and clean the inside of the car-- I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1629
02:04:33,532 --> 02:04:37,460
Go in the back seat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull.

1630
02:04:37,531 --> 02:04:40,470
Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery.

1631
02:04:40,540 --> 02:04:43,469
It don't need to be spick-and-span. You don't need to eat off it.

1632
02:04:43,540 --> 02:04:47,908
Just give it a good once-over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.

1633
02:04:47,981 --> 02:04:52,069
The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.

1634
02:04:52,150 --> 02:04:54,579
We need to raid your linen closet.

1635
02:04:54,650 --> 02:04:57,579
I need blankets, I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1636
02:04:57,650 --> 02:05:01,278
The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

1637
02:05:01,359 --> 02:05:06,658
We'll need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards...

1638
02:05:06,730 --> 02:05:08,659
with quilts and blankets,

1639
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:12,668
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last,

1640
02:05:12,729 --> 02:05:15,598
but at a glance the car will appear to be normal.

1641
02:05:15,669 --> 02:05:17,728
Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.

1642
02:05:17,809 --> 02:05:19,568
"Please" would be nice.

1643
02:05:21,038 --> 02:05:23,977
- Come again ? - I said, a "please" would be nice.

1644
02:05:25,878 --> 02:05:29,706
Get it straight, buster. I'm not here to say please. I'm here to tell you what to do.

1645
02:05:31,518 --> 02:05:34,447
And if self-preservation is an instinct you possess,

1646
02:05:34,517 --> 02:05:36,956
you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick.

1647
02:05:37,027 --> 02:05:40,925
I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1648
02:05:40,998 --> 02:05:44,326
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that; your help is definitely appreciated.

1649
02:05:44,398 --> 02:05:47,327
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean disrespect, okay ? I respect you.

1650
02:05:47,397 --> 02:05:50,196
I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.

1651
02:05:50,267 --> 02:05:53,325
If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor.

1652
02:05:53,407 --> 02:05:58,036
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1653
02:05:58,107 --> 02:06:01,545
So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.

1654
02:06:06,046 --> 02:06:09,714
Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right ? I can feel your look.

1655
02:06:12,425 --> 02:06:15,114
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1656
02:06:17,196 --> 02:06:19,125
Green.

1657
02:06:20,736 --> 02:06:23,665
Nothin' except for the mess inside.

1658
02:06:25,865 --> 02:06:28,304
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1659
02:06:29,805 --> 02:06:31,744
Nobody who'll be missed.

1660
02:06:33,815 --> 02:06:36,744
You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch.

1661
02:06:37,845 --> 02:06:39,784
- How we comin', Jimmie ? - Pretty good.

1662
02:06:39,844 --> 02:06:43,012
- I got it all here, but, uh,

1663
02:06:43,084 --> 02:06:46,522
- Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something. - Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1664
02:06:46,584 --> 02:06:50,112
Okay. You gotta understand something, uh, Winston.

1665
02:06:50,193 --> 02:06:52,122
Uh-- Uh, no, thank you.

1666
02:06:52,194 --> 02:06:55,322
Uh, this is our best linen here,

1667
02:06:55,393 --> 02:06:58,332
and it's, uh-- it was a wedding present...

1668
02:06:58,403 --> 02:07:00,832
from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.

1669
02:07:00,903 --> 02:07:05,341
- They're not with us anymore. I wanna help-- - Let me ask you a question.

1670
02:07:05,403 --> 02:07:08,342
- If you don't mind. - No, no, please. Go ahead.

1671
02:07:09,913 --> 02:07:14,812
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, were they millionaires ?

1672
02:07:15,952 --> 02:07:17,881
No.

1673
02:07:17,952 --> 02:07:20,381
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1674
02:07:20,452 --> 02:07:23,910
And I'm positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1675
02:07:23,991 --> 02:07:26,420
- Ginny. - Ginny were here,

1676
02:07:26,491 --> 02:07:30,759
they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set,

1677
02:07:30,831 --> 02:07:33,959
which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.

1678
02:07:37,941 --> 02:07:41,869
I like oak myself. That's what I have in my bedroom.

1679
02:07:43,010 --> 02:07:44,939
How about you, Jimmie ?

1680
02:07:46,181 --> 02:07:48,110
You an oak man ?

1681
02:07:49,211 --> 02:07:51,150
Oak's nice.

1682
02:07:56,989 --> 02:08:00,857
Oh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit.

1683
02:08:00,929 --> 02:08:03,358
This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.

1684
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:06,858
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he is wrong that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings ?

1685
02:08:06,930 --> 02:08:09,869
that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings ?

1686
02:08:09,929 --> 02:08:12,868
Get the fuck out my face with that shit !

1687
02:08:12,939 --> 02:08:15,798
The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1688
02:08:15,869 --> 02:08:19,637
- on account of your dumb ass. - I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take.

1689
02:08:19,708 --> 02:08:23,306
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car, and you got me in the red.

1690
02:08:23,378 --> 02:08:26,816
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1691
02:08:26,878 --> 02:08:28,817
That's all. I could blow.

1692
02:08:28,888 --> 02:08:30,817
- Oh, you ready to blow ? - Yeah.

1693
02:08:30,888 --> 02:08:33,817
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker, motherfucker.

1694
02:08:33,888 --> 02:08:36,827
Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1695
02:08:36,887 --> 02:08:38,826
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1696
02:08:38,898 --> 02:08:41,827
In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back ?

1697
02:08:41,897 --> 02:08:45,125
You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail ! We're fuckin' switchin'.

1698
02:08:45,197 --> 02:08:47,636
I'm washin' windows, and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull !

1699
02:08:57,417 --> 02:08:59,346
Fine job, gentlemen.

1700
02:09:00,687 --> 02:09:03,116
You may get out of this yet.

1701
02:09:03,186 --> 02:09:05,615
I can't believe this is the same car.

1702
02:09:05,686 --> 02:09:09,124
Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet.

1703
02:09:09,185 --> 02:09:12,623
Phase one is complete-- Clean the car-- which moves us right along to Phase two:

1704
02:09:12,695 --> 02:09:14,624
Clean you two.

1705
02:09:16,196 --> 02:09:18,065
Strip.

1706
02:09:18,135 --> 02:09:21,893
- All the way ? -  To your bare ass.

1707
02:09:21,965 --> 02:09:25,063
Quickly, gentlemen. We got about 15 minutes...

1708
02:09:25,135 --> 02:09:28,074
before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway.

1709
02:09:28,145 --> 02:09:30,634
Goddamn, this morning air is some chilly shit.

1710
02:09:30,714 --> 02:09:32,663
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary ?

1711
02:09:32,795 --> 02:09:35,094
- You know what you two look like ? - What ?

1712
02:09:35,164 --> 02:09:38,602
Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head.

1713
02:09:38,664 --> 02:09:42,032
Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.

1714
02:09:46,344 --> 02:09:48,813
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1715
02:09:48,873 --> 02:09:53,311
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for the garbageman to pick up.

1716
02:09:53,383 --> 02:09:57,611
Don't worry, we're taking it with us. Jim, the soap.

1717
02:09:59,053 --> 02:10:00,992
- Vincent. - Okay, gentlemen.

1718
02:10:01,053 --> 02:10:04,551
You both been to County before, I'm sure. Here it comes.

1719
02:10:04,622 --> 02:10:07,561
- Goddamn ! The water's fuckin' cold ! - Yo ! Yo ! Yo !

1720
02:10:07,633 --> 02:10:10,861
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1721
02:10:10,932 --> 02:10:13,871
- Don't be afraid of the soap. Spread it around.

1722
02:10:13,932 --> 02:10:16,801
- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair. - Hey, get out of my hair !

1723
02:10:16,872 --> 02:10:19,771
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it ! Do it ! - Uh, um--

1724
02:10:20,842 --> 02:10:22,771
Towel.

1725
02:10:33,291 --> 02:10:36,449
You're dry enough. Toss 'em their clothes.

1726
02:10:36,521 --> 02:10:39,789
Perfect.

1727
02:10:39,861 --> 02:10:43,319
Perfect. We couldn't have planned this better.

1728
02:10:43,401 --> 02:10:45,330
You guys look like--

1729
02:10:45,401 --> 02:10:47,830
What do they look like, Jimmie ?

1730
02:10:47,901 --> 02:10:51,499
- Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.

1731
02:10:51,570 --> 02:10:55,058
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.

1732
02:10:55,139 --> 02:10:57,868
Come on, gentlemen. We're laughing our way right into prison.

1733
02:10:57,939 --> 02:10:59,878
Don't make me beg.

1734
02:11:02,950 --> 02:11:06,378
Okay, gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight.

1735
02:11:06,450 --> 02:11:10,008
We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1736
02:11:10,089 --> 02:11:13,018
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1737
02:11:13,088 --> 02:11:14,987
The place is North Hollywood,

1738
02:11:15,059 --> 02:11:19,047
so a few twists and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1739
02:11:19,129 --> 02:11:22,457
Now, I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me.

1740
02:11:23,869 --> 02:11:25,798
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

1741
02:11:25,868 --> 02:11:29,806
Now, if we come across the path of any John Q. Laws,

1742
02:11:29,878 --> 02:11:32,966
- nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something. - Right.

1743
02:11:33,048 --> 02:11:35,977
- What did I say ? - Don't do shit unless.

1744
02:11:36,047 --> 02:11:38,306
- Unless what ? - Unless you do it first.

1745
02:11:38,378 --> 02:11:40,817
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1746
02:11:40,887 --> 02:11:44,315
How about you, Lash LaRue ? Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling ?

1747
02:11:44,387 --> 02:11:48,485
The gun went off. I don't know why. I'm cool. I promise you.

1748
02:11:48,556 --> 02:11:51,495
Fair enough. Now, I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1749
02:11:51,556 --> 02:11:54,055
If get my car back any different than I gave it,

1750
02:11:54,126 --> 02:11:57,065
Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.

1751
02:12:00,906 --> 02:12:02,595
Outta my way, Rex.

1752
02:12:04,176 --> 02:12:06,605
- We cool ? - Like it never happened.

1753
02:12:06,675 --> 02:12:10,443
-  All right. - Boys, this is Raquel.

1754
02:12:10,515 --> 02:12:13,134
Someday all this will be hers.

1755
02:12:13,216 --> 02:12:16,085
Hi. So, what's with the outfits ?

1756
02:12:16,155 --> 02:12:19,583
- You guys going to a volleyball game or something ?

1757
02:12:19,655 --> 02:12:22,084
I'm takin' milady out for breakfast.

1758
02:12:22,155 --> 02:12:24,924
Maybe I could drop you two off. Where do you live ?

1759
02:12:24,994 --> 02:12:26,353
- Redondo. - Inglewood.

1760
02:12:26,425 --> 02:12:29,863
It's-- It's your future. I--

1761
02:12:29,934 --> 02:12:32,693
I see a-- a cab ride.

1762
02:12:32,765 --> 02:12:35,734
Move outta the sticks, fellas. Say good night, Raquel.

1763
02:12:35,805 --> 02:12:38,734
- Good night, Raquel. - I'll see you guys around.

1764
02:12:38,804 --> 02:12:41,243
Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.

1765
02:12:41,304 --> 02:12:45,242
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work.

1766
02:12:45,313 --> 02:12:48,242
Yeah, really. And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1767
02:12:48,314 --> 02:12:50,243
Call me Winston.

1768
02:12:51,813 --> 02:12:54,752
- You see that, young lady ? Respect.

1769
02:12:54,823 --> 02:12:59,021
- Respect for one's elders shows character. - I have character.

1770
02:12:59,093 --> 02:13:03,121
- Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character.

1771
02:13:09,702 --> 02:13:12,631
- Wanna share a cab ?

1772
02:13:12,702 --> 02:13:16,970
- I'd go for some breakfast. Feel like havin' breakfast with me ?

1773
02:13:17,042 --> 02:13:19,841
Cool.

1774
02:13:23,882 --> 02:13:26,970
I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something.

1775
02:13:27,051 --> 02:13:30,489
- Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob. - I know that now.

1776
02:13:30,551 --> 02:13:32,990
- But was he cool or what ? - Thank you.

1777
02:13:33,061 --> 02:13:35,490
Totally fuckin' cool, in control.

1778
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:39,618
Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1779
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:42,289
- Want some bacon ?

1780
02:13:42,361 --> 02:13:44,300
No, man, I don't eat pork.

1781
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:47,798
- Are you Jewish ? - I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all.

1782
02:13:47,870 --> 02:13:50,809
- Why not ? - Pigs are filthy animals.

1783
02:13:50,870 --> 02:13:52,809
I don't eat filthy animals.

1784
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:56,308
Yeah, but bacon tastes good. Pork chops taste good.

1785
02:13:56,379 --> 02:13:59,308
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know...

1786
02:13:59,380 --> 02:14:02,319
'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.

1787
02:14:02,379 --> 02:14:05,318
Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal.

1788
02:14:05,389 --> 02:14:09,317
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1789
02:14:09,389 --> 02:14:13,727
- What about a dog ? Dog eats its own feces. - I don't eat dog either.

1790
02:14:13,799 --> 02:14:17,127
Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal ?

1791
02:14:17,199 --> 02:14:20,128
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy,

1792
02:14:20,198 --> 02:14:22,137
but they're definitely dirty.

1793
02:14:22,199 --> 02:14:26,327
- But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way. - Ah, so, by that rationale,

1794
02:14:26,408 --> 02:14:29,966
if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1795
02:14:30,047 --> 02:14:33,975
- Is that true ? - We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1796
02:14:34,047 --> 02:14:38,075
I mean, he'd have to be ten times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.

1797
02:14:43,687 --> 02:14:45,816
Oh, man, that's good.

1798
02:14:45,887 --> 02:14:49,485
That's good, man. You're startin' to lighten up.

1799
02:14:49,567 --> 02:14:52,555
You've been sittin' there, all serious and shit.

1800
02:14:52,636 --> 02:14:55,065
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'. - About what ?

1801
02:14:55,137 --> 02:14:58,066
- About the miracle we witnessed. - Miracle you witnessed.

1802
02:14:58,137 --> 02:15:01,405
- I witnessed a freak occurrence. - What is a miracle, Vincent ?

1803
02:15:03,306 --> 02:15:06,504
- Act of God. - And what's an act of God ?

1804
02:15:09,985 --> 02:15:13,813
When, um, God makes the impossible possible.

1805
02:15:14,855 --> 02:15:16,784
But this morning...

1806
02:15:16,855 --> 02:15:19,584
- I don't think qualifies. - Hey, Vincent.

1807
02:15:19,655 --> 02:15:23,353
See, that shit don't matter. You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1808
02:15:23,424 --> 02:15:28,363
It could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.

1809
02:15:28,435 --> 02:15:31,423
You don't judge shit like this based on merit.

1810
02:15:31,504 --> 02:15:33,933
Now, whether or not what we experienced...

1811
02:15:34,005 --> 02:15:37,163
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant.

1812
02:15:37,244 --> 02:15:41,002
But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God.

1813
02:15:41,073 --> 02:15:43,012
God got involved.

1814
02:15:43,084 --> 02:15:44,803
But why ?

1815
02:15:44,883 --> 02:15:47,901
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why.

1816
02:15:47,984 --> 02:15:50,953
- But I can't go back to sleep. - You're serious.

1817
02:15:51,024 --> 02:15:52,953
You're really thinkin' about quittin'.

1818
02:15:53,023 --> 02:15:55,682
- For life ? Most definitely. - Yeah.

1819
02:15:55,753 --> 02:15:59,121
Fuck. What you gonna do then ?

1820
02:16:00,433 --> 02:16:04,661
Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating.

1821
02:16:04,733 --> 02:16:08,331
First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus.

1822
02:16:08,402 --> 02:16:11,490
Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the Earth.

1823
02:16:11,572 --> 02:16:15,010
- What you mean, "walk the Earth" ? - Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1824
02:16:15,072 --> 02:16:18,041
Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures.

1825
02:16:18,112 --> 02:16:20,371
And how long do you intend to walk the Earth ?

1826
02:16:20,451 --> 02:16:23,749
- 'Til God puts me where He wants me to be. - What if He don't do that ?

1827
02:16:23,822 --> 02:16:28,751
- If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever. - So you decided to be a bum.

1828
02:16:28,821 --> 02:16:32,479
I'll just be Jules, Vincent. No more, no less.

1829
02:16:32,561 --> 02:16:34,530
No, Jules, you decided to be a bum,

1830
02:16:34,590 --> 02:16:37,888
just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change,

1831
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:40,899
who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away.

1832
02:16:40,971 --> 02:16:43,940
They got a name for that, Jules. It's called a bum.

1833
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,668
And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.

1834
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:49,669
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.

1835
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:52,679
Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ.

1836
02:16:52,749 --> 02:16:55,578
GarÃ§on ! Coffee !

1837
02:16:55,649 --> 02:17:00,138
Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar.

1838
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:03,348
- But water into wine, l-- - All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1839
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:06,518
- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man. - If my answers frighten you,

1840
02:17:06,589 --> 02:17:09,188
then you should cease asking scary questions.

1841
02:17:12,059 --> 02:17:13,998
I'm gonna take a shit.

1842
02:17:16,869 --> 02:17:20,617
Let me ask you something.

1843
02:17:20,749 --> 02:17:22,878
When did you make this decision ? When you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin ?

1844
02:17:22,948 --> 02:17:26,886
Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

1845
02:17:26,958 --> 02:17:28,887
replayin' the incident in my head,

1846
02:17:28,958 --> 02:17:32,756
when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity.

1847
02:17:32,827 --> 02:17:35,955
Fuck. To be continued.

1848
02:17:47,977 --> 02:17:50,906
- I love you, Pumpkin. - I love you, Honey Bunny.

1849
02:17:52,517 --> 02:17:55,446
- Everybody be cool ! This is a robbery !

1850
02:17:55,516 --> 02:18:00,505
Any one of you fucking pricks move, and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers !

1851
02:18:00,586 --> 02:18:03,984
- You got that ? You just be quiet over there ! - Waitresses on the floor !

1852
02:18:04,055 --> 02:18:07,113
Get on the fuckin'-- Get the fuck down !

1853
02:18:07,195 --> 02:18:11,924
You're in a blind spot. Take your dames over to that booth, on the count of ten !

1854
02:18:11,995 --> 02:18:16,564
- Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen ! - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--

1855
02:18:16,635 --> 02:18:19,733
What the fuck are you doing, you fucking yuppie ? Get down !

1856
02:18:19,805 --> 02:18:22,274
- Get down ! - Throw those bags !

1857
02:18:22,345 --> 02:18:24,834
- Fucking move ! Move !

1858
02:18:24,914 --> 02:18:27,173
- Move ! Get the fuck--

1859
02:18:27,245 --> 02:18:30,273
Get down on the fucking floor !

1860
02:18:30,354 --> 02:18:32,283
Grandpa ! Down !

1861
02:18:32,355 --> 02:18:35,713
I'm the manager here, and there's no problem. No problem at all.

1862
02:18:35,784 --> 02:18:38,723
- You gonna give me a problem ? - No, sir, I'm not.

1863
02:18:38,793 --> 02:18:42,811
Thought you said you were gonna give me a fucking problem !

1864
02:18:42,893 --> 02:18:47,592
- I think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny. - Well, just execute him !

1865
02:18:47,663 --> 02:18:49,602
- I am not a hero.

1866
02:18:49,664 --> 02:18:52,692
- I'm just a coffee shop manager. - Get the fuck down !

1867
02:18:52,773 --> 02:18:54,532
The restaurant's ours !

1868
02:18:54,603 --> 02:18:57,542
- Just take whatever you want.

1869
02:18:57,612 --> 02:18:59,541
- You talk to the customers. - Yeah.

1870
02:18:59,612 --> 02:19:02,740
You tell them to be fucking cool and everything will be over.

1871
02:19:02,813 --> 02:19:04,782
- You understand me ? - Yes !

1872
02:19:07,083 --> 02:19:08,882
Listen, everybody.

1873
02:19:08,952 --> 02:19:10,981
Be calm, cooperate,

1874
02:19:11,052 --> 02:19:13,991
and this'll all be over in a minute !

1875
02:19:14,062 --> 02:19:16,021
Get the fuck down ! Well done.

1876
02:19:28,371 --> 02:19:31,809
All right, now, people, gonna come around and collect your wallets !

1877
02:19:31,871 --> 02:19:35,329
You don't fucking talk. You just throw 'em in the bag ! Are we clear ?

1878
02:19:35,410 --> 02:19:37,639
I said, are we fucking clear ?

1879
02:19:37,710 --> 02:19:40,649
Good ! Now, wallets out !

1880
02:19:40,721 --> 02:19:44,309
That's it. Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1881
02:19:44,390 --> 02:19:47,319
- In the fucking bag ! - I don't have nothin' on me, man.

1882
02:19:47,390 --> 02:19:49,249
In the bag.

1883
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:52,259
What am I waiting for ? ln the fucking bag.

1884
02:19:52,330 --> 02:19:55,259
Laura. Laura. Tips. In the bag.

1885
02:19:55,329 --> 02:19:57,558
- Is that a cellular phone ? - Yeah.

1886
02:19:57,630 --> 02:19:59,569
In the fucking bag.

1887
02:20:01,140 --> 02:20:04,588
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it. Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1888
02:20:04,669 --> 02:20:07,108
In the bag. In the bag.

1889
02:20:19,289 --> 02:20:21,218
In the bag.

1890
02:20:36,338 --> 02:20:39,267
- What's in the case ? - My boss's dirty laundry.

1891
02:20:39,337 --> 02:20:41,866
- Your boss makes you do his laundry ? - When he wants it clean.

1892
02:20:41,937 --> 02:20:44,636
- Sounds like a shit job. - Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1893
02:20:44,706 --> 02:20:47,645
- Open it. - 'Fraid I can't do that.

1894
02:20:49,677 --> 02:20:52,046
- I didn't hear you. - Yes, you did.

1895
02:20:53,116 --> 02:20:55,445
What's going on ?

1896
02:20:55,516 --> 02:20:58,974
- Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst. - Shoot him in the face !

1897
02:20:59,056 --> 02:21:02,784
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.

1898
02:21:02,855 --> 02:21:06,263
- If you don't take your hand off that case, it'll be your last. - Stop causing problems !

1899
02:21:06,325 --> 02:21:09,124
You'll get us all killed ! Give 'em what you got and get 'em outta here !

1900
02:21:09,196 --> 02:21:13,434
Shut the fuck up, fat man ! This ain't none of your goddamn business !

1901
02:21:13,505 --> 02:21:15,734
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.

1902
02:21:15,805 --> 02:21:17,894
No problem. I got it under control.

1903
02:21:19,474 --> 02:21:21,463
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1904
02:21:23,074 --> 02:21:27,012
If you don't open that case, I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1905
02:21:31,424 --> 02:21:33,353
We clear ?

1906
02:21:36,494 --> 02:21:38,423
One.

1907
02:21:40,263 --> 02:21:42,782
Two.

1908
02:21:42,863 --> 02:21:44,922
- Three. - Okay, Ringo.

1909
02:21:45,004 --> 02:21:47,063
You win.

1910
02:21:47,133 --> 02:21:49,072
It's yours.

1911
02:21:53,103 --> 02:21:55,832
- Open it.

1912
02:21:59,712 --> 02:22:01,941
Hey, what is it ?

1913
02:22:02,013 --> 02:22:04,352
What is it ?

1914
02:22:04,422 --> 02:22:07,011
Is that what I think it is ?

1915
02:22:07,082 --> 02:22:09,781
Mm-hmm.

1916
02:22:11,362 --> 02:22:13,481
It's beautiful.

1917
02:22:13,561 --> 02:22:16,120
Goddamn it, what is it ?

1918
02:22:17,601 --> 02:22:20,530
You let him go ! You let him go !

1919
02:22:20,602 --> 02:22:23,571
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you ! - Tell that bitch to be cool.

1920
02:22:23,632 --> 02:22:26,571
- Say, "Bitch, be cool !" Say, "Bitch, be cool !" - Be cool ! Be cool !

1921
02:22:26,641 --> 02:22:29,370
- Tell that bitch to chill ! - You're gonna die so fuckin' bad !

1922
02:22:29,441 --> 02:22:32,340
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out ! - Chill out, Honey Bunny !

1923
02:22:32,411 --> 02:22:34,210
- Let go of him ! - Chill out, Honey Bunny !

1924
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:37,209
- Now, promise her it's gonna be all right ! - I promise !

1925
02:22:37,281 --> 02:22:39,180
- Tell her to chill ! - Chill out, Honey Bunny !

1926
02:22:39,251 --> 02:22:41,180
- Now tell me her name. - Yolanda.

1927
02:22:41,251 --> 02:22:44,689
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not gonna do anything stupid, are we ?

1928
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:47,689
- Don't you hurt him ! - Nobody's gonna hurt anybody !

1929
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:51,248
We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like ?

1930
02:22:51,330 --> 02:22:54,988
- Come on, Yolanda ! What's Fonzie like ? - He's cool.

1931
02:22:55,070 --> 02:22:56,999
- What ? - Cool.

1932
02:22:57,070 --> 02:22:59,899
Correctamundo. And that's what we're gonna be.

1933
02:22:59,970 --> 02:23:01,909
We're gonna be cool.

1934
02:23:01,969 --> 02:23:06,878
Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.

1935
02:23:06,938 --> 02:23:09,037
And when I count three,

1936
02:23:09,109 --> 02:23:12,048
I want you to let go of your gun,

1937
02:23:12,118 --> 02:23:15,566
put your palms flat on the table and sit your ass down.

1938
02:23:16,648 --> 02:23:18,707
And when you do it,

1939
02:23:18,788 --> 02:23:20,847
you do it cool.

1940
02:23:20,928 --> 02:23:23,257
You ready ?

1941
02:23:23,328 --> 02:23:25,417
One,

1942
02:23:25,497 --> 02:23:27,686
two,

1943
02:23:27,767 --> 02:23:29,696
three.

1944
02:23:36,667 --> 02:23:39,795
-  Okay, now you let him go ! - Yolanda !

1945
02:23:39,877 --> 02:23:43,465
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

1946
02:23:43,547 --> 02:23:45,636
When I get nervous, I get scared.

1947
02:23:45,716 --> 02:23:49,544
When motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

1948
02:23:51,186 --> 02:23:54,814
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1949
02:23:54,886 --> 02:23:58,284
Well, that seems to be the situation.

1950
02:23:58,356 --> 02:24:00,295
But I don't want that.

1951
02:24:00,355 --> 02:24:02,294
And you don't want that.

1952
02:24:02,366 --> 02:24:05,095
And Ringo here definitely doesn't want that.

1953
02:24:05,165 --> 02:24:07,254
So let's see what we can do.

1954
02:24:09,665 --> 02:24:12,903
Now... here's the situation.

1955
02:24:12,975 --> 02:24:16,843
Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

1956
02:24:16,905 --> 02:24:20,343
but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period,

1957
02:24:20,415 --> 02:24:23,344
and I don't wanna kill you; I wanna help you.

1958
02:24:23,414 --> 02:24:27,352
But I can't give you this case, 'cause it don't belong to me.

1959
02:24:27,424 --> 02:24:30,353
Besides, I been through too much shit over this case this morning...

1960
02:24:30,424 --> 02:24:33,353
to just hand it over to your dumb ass.

1961
02:24:33,424 --> 02:24:35,293
- Vincent !

1962
02:24:35,364 --> 02:24:38,293
- Be cool ! Yolanda, it's cool, baby. - Get back !

1963
02:24:38,364 --> 02:24:41,063
It's cool ! We still just talkin'.

1964
02:24:41,133 --> 02:24:45,291
- Come on. Point the gun at me. Point the gun at me. There you go.

1965
02:24:45,373 --> 02:24:47,432
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

1966
02:24:47,503 --> 02:24:49,442
and don't do a goddamn thing.

1967
02:24:49,503 --> 02:24:51,442
Tell her it's still cool.

1968
02:24:51,513 --> 02:24:54,442
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny. - How we doin', baby ?

1969
02:24:55,843 --> 02:24:58,512
I-- I gotta go pee.

1970
02:24:58,582 --> 02:25:00,511
I wanna go home.

1971
02:25:00,583 --> 02:25:04,181
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you. And Ringo's proud of you.

1972
02:25:04,253 --> 02:25:07,192
It's almost over. Tell her you're proud of her.

1973
02:25:07,252 --> 02:25:10,620
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny. - I love you.

1974
02:25:10,692 --> 02:25:13,850
- I love you too, Honey Bunny. - Now,

1975
02:25:13,932 --> 02:25:17,860
I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.

1976
02:25:20,401 --> 02:25:24,339
- Which one is it ? - It's the one that says "Bad Motherfucker."

1977
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:41,159
That's it. That's my bad motherfucker.

1978
02:25:41,230 --> 02:25:44,328
Open it up. Take out the money.

1979
02:25:49,380 --> 02:25:51,539
Count it.

1980
02:25:57,850 --> 02:26:00,379
How much is there ?

1981
02:26:02,289 --> 02:26:04,218
About 1,500 dollars.

1982
02:26:04,289 --> 02:26:07,487
Okay, put it in your pocket. It's yours.

1983
02:26:07,559 --> 02:26:10,757
Now, with the rest of those wallets and the register,

1984
02:26:10,829 --> 02:26:12,918
that makes this a pretty successful little score, huh ?

1985
02:26:12,999 --> 02:26:16,897
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.

1986
02:26:16,968 --> 02:26:20,406
No, Yolanda ! Yolanda ! He ain't gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing !

1987
02:26:20,468 --> 02:26:22,567
Vince, shut the fuck up !

1988
02:26:22,637 --> 02:26:26,505
- Shut up ! - Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

1989
02:26:26,577 --> 02:26:29,506
Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.

1990
02:26:29,578 --> 02:26:31,517
I'm buyin' something for my money.

1991
02:26:32,747 --> 02:26:35,945
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo ? - What ?

1992
02:26:36,017 --> 02:26:40,756
Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass.

1993
02:26:40,826 --> 02:26:43,515
You read the Bible, Ringo ?

1994
02:26:44,596 --> 02:26:46,525
Not regularly, no.

1995
02:26:46,597 --> 02:26:49,026
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

1996
02:26:49,097 --> 02:26:52,625
Ezekiel 25:17.

1997
02:26:52,706 --> 02:26:55,535
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides...

1998
02:26:55,606 --> 02:26:57,535
by the inequities of the selfish...

1999
02:26:57,606 --> 02:26:59,535
and the tyranny of evil men.

2000
02:26:59,605 --> 02:27:02,973
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will,

2001
02:27:03,045 --> 02:27:05,474
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,

2002
02:27:05,546 --> 02:27:09,644
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.

2003
02:27:09,716 --> 02:27:14,014
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...

2004
02:27:14,085 --> 02:27:17,143
those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.

2005
02:27:17,224 --> 02:27:20,252
And you will know I am the Lord...

2006
02:27:20,324 --> 02:27:23,882
when I lay My vengeance upon you."

2007
02:27:24,965 --> 02:27:27,404
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2008
02:27:27,465 --> 02:27:30,633
and if you heard it, that meant your ass.

2009
02:27:30,704 --> 02:27:33,643
I never gave much thought to what it meant.

2010
02:27:33,704 --> 02:27:36,643
I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker...

2011
02:27:36,714 --> 02:27:39,143
before I popped a cap in his ass.

2012
02:27:39,213 --> 02:27:42,641
But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice.

2013
02:27:42,714 --> 02:27:45,653
See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means...

2014
02:27:45,724 --> 02:27:50,583
you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man,

2015
02:27:50,653 --> 02:27:53,592
and Mr. 9-millimeter here, he's the shepherd...

2016
02:27:53,663 --> 02:27:57,221
protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.

2017
02:27:57,292 --> 02:27:59,231
Or it could mean...

2018
02:27:59,303 --> 02:28:02,731
you're the righteous man, and I'm the shepherd,

2019
02:28:02,803 --> 02:28:06,741
and it's the world that's evil and selfish.

2020
02:28:06,802 --> 02:28:09,071
Now, I'd like that.

2021
02:28:09,142 --> 02:28:12,041
But that shit ain't the truth.

2022
02:28:12,112 --> 02:28:13,971
The truth is,

2023
02:28:15,041 --> 02:28:16,980
you're the weak...

2024
02:28:18,382 --> 02:28:21,780
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2025
02:28:23,191 --> 02:28:25,120
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2026
02:28:26,391 --> 02:28:29,320
I'm tryin' real hard...

2027
02:28:29,391 --> 02:28:31,660
to be the shepherd.

2028
02:28:46,980 --> 02:28:48,909
Go.

2029
02:29:06,598 --> 02:29:09,027
I think we should be leaving now.

2030
02:29:09,100 --> 02:29:12,029
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
