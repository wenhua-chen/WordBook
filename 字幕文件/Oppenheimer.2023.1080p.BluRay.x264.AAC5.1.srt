1
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:33,042
-(suspenseful music playing) -(rain pattering)

2
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,588
(violent whooshing)

3
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:54,830
(erupting)

4
00:00:55,997 --> 00:00:58,667
(disembodied rhythmic stomping)

5
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,735
(music intensifying)

6
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,774
(stomping intensifying)

7
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:16,419
-(stomping stops) -(exhales)

8
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,687
(pensive music playing)

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,755
GORDON GRAY: Dr. Oppenheimer.

10
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:22,958
Dr. Oppenheimer.

11
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,894
As we begin, I believe you have

12
00:01:25,927 --> 00:01:27,929
a statement to read into the record.

13
00:01:29,764 --> 00:01:30,966
Yes, Your Honor.

14
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,102
WARD EVANS: We're not judges, Doctor.

15
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:34,170
No.

16
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:36,671
Of course.

17
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:44,813
Members of the security board,

18
00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:47,150
the so-called derogatory information

19
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:50,086
in your indictment of me cannot be fairly understood,

20
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,955
except in the context of my life and my work.

21
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:57,160
SENATE AIDE: How long did he testify?

22
00:01:57,193 --> 00:01:58,927
Honestly, I forget.

23
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,298
The whole hearing took a month.

24
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,765
An ordeal, hmm?

25
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:05,468
Well, I've only read the transcripts.

26
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:06,968
(clears throat)

27
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:09,771
Who'd want to justify their whole life?

28
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:11,039
You weren't there?

29
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:13,376
As chairman, I wasn't allowed to be.

30
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,977
Are they really going to ask about it?

31
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,114
-It was years ago. -Four years ago...

32
00:02:18,147 --> 00:02:19,182
Five.

33
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,783
Oppenheimer still divides America.

34
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:24,187
The committee is gonna want to know where you stood.

35
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,322
Senator Thurmond asked me to say

36
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,191
not to feel that you're on trial.

37
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,760
Oh, funny, I didn't till you just said that.

38
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,396
-Really, Mr. Strauss... -It's Admiral.

39
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:36,365
Um, Admiral Strauss. This is a formality.

40
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,900
President Eisenhower has asked you to be in his cabinet.

41
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:40,802
Senate really has no choice but to confirm you.

42
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:43,072
And if they bring up Oppenheimer?

43
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:45,474
When they bring up Oppenheimer, you answer honestly.

44
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,909
No senator can deny you did your duty.

45
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:50,079
It'll be uncomfortable. (chuckles awkwardly)

46
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:52,248
Who'd want to justify their whole life?

47
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:54,983
(clamoring)

48
00:02:57,186 --> 00:02:59,888
ROGER ROBB: Why did you leave the United States?

49
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,394
I, uh... I wanted to study the new physics.

50
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:06,962
Was there nowhere here?

51
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:08,997
I thought Berkeley had the leading

52
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,865
theoretical physics department.

53
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,469
Yes. Once I built it.

54
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:15,104
But first I had to go to Europe.

55
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:18,507
I went to Cambridge to study under Patrick Blackett.

56
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,143
Were you happier there than in America?

57
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:23,312
-Happier? -Yes.

58
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:25,880
(unsettling music playing)

59
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:30,286
No. No, I, uh...

60
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,124
<i>I was homesick, um...</i>

61
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:37,959
...emotionally immature...

62
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:44,267
<i>...troubled by visions</i> <i>of a hidden universe.</i>

63
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,767
(soft blast)

64
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:51,073
(rumbling)

65
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:57,146
Useless in the lab.

66
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:58,780
(glass shattering)

67
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:04,287
Christ, Oppenheimer.

68
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,389
Have you had any sleep?

69
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,425
Start again.

70
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,960
I need to go to the lecture, sir.

71
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:13,396
Why?

72
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:15,331
It's Niels Bohr.

73
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,834
Damn, completely forgot.

74
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:22,071
All right. (clears throat) Let's go.

75
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:26,309
-Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer. -(students laughing)

76
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:27,443
You finish coating those plates.

77
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,312
STUDENT 1: You see them?

78
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:31,147
(students laughing)

79
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:36,851
STUDENT 2: Don't forget to clean up!

80
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:04,380
(cabinet door closes)

81
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,953
<i>Quantum physics</i> <i>is not a step forward,</i>

82
00:05:11,986 --> 00:05:15,491
it is a new way to understand reality.

83
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:19,095
Einstein's opened the door, now we are peering through,

84
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:22,030
seeing a world inside our world.

85
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:27,470
A world of energy and paradox that not everyone can accept.

86
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:32,108
(unsettling music continues)

87
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:37,879
(rumbling)

88
00:05:58,032 --> 00:05:59,934
-(music fades out) -(bell tolling)

89
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:05,441
(indistinct chatter)

90
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,012
Yeah, definitely.

91
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,415
-(panting) -Are you all right?

92
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:15,484
Niels, meet J. Robert Oppenheimer.

93
00:06:15,518 --> 00:06:17,018
What's the "J" stand for?

94
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:19,020
Nothing, apparently.

95
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:20,156
You were at my lecture.

96
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:21,590
You asked the only good question.

97
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:23,359
No one's denying his insight.

98
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,461
It's his laboratory work that leaves a little to be desired.

99
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:27,329
(swallows) I heard you give the same lecture...

100
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:30,566
At Harvard, yes, and you asked the same question.

101
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,700
Why ask again?

102
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:33,335
Hadn't liked your answer.

103
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:36,439
Did you like it better yesterday?

104
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:37,740
A lot.

105
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,675
You can lift the stone without being ready

106
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,077
for the snake that's revealed.

107
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,246
Now it seems you're ready.

108
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,582
-But you don't enjoy the lab? -(continues panting)

109
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,485
So get out of Cambridge with its beakers and potions.

110
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:52,488
Go somewhere they let you think.

111
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,124
(whispers): Where?

112
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:56,759
Göttingen.

113
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,727
-Born? -Born.

114
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:00,729
Get to Germany, study under Max Born.

115
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:03,399
Learn the ways of theory.

116
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:04,467
I'll send word.

117
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,068
(gasps)

118
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:08,204
-Wormhole. (exhales) -(apple clatters in trashcan)

119
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:09,605
How's your mathematics?

120
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,607
Not good enough for the physicist he wants to be.

121
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,210
Algebra's like sheet music.

122
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:16,712
The important thing isn't "Can you read music?"

123
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:17,746
It's "Can you hear it?"

124
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,083
Can you hear the music, Robert?

125
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:23,619
Yes, I can.

126
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,188
(classical music playing)

127
00:07:28,357 --> 00:07:31,025
-(rumbling) -(metallic clinking)

128
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:35,531
(music intensifying)

129
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,302
(intense classical music continues)

130
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:20,442
(rumbling)

131
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,458
(rumbling)

132
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:43,599
(music tempo increasing)

133
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,315
(music ends)

134
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:00,849
The senator from Wyoming.

135
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:04,286
Admiral Strauss, I'm interested in your relationship

136
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,189
with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

137
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:08,824
You met him in 1947?

138
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:09,825
Correct.

139
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:11,627
You were commissioner

140
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,228
of the Atomic Energy Commission?

141
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:17,199
I was, but I-I actually met Robert in my capacity

142
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:19,902
as board member of the Institute for Advanced Study

143
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,737
at Princeton because

144
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,406
after the war, he was world-renowned

145
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,842
as the great man of physics, and I was determined

146
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,578
to get him to run the Institute.

147
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,714
(birds chirping)

148
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:34,416
(soft music playing)

149
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:41,824
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

150
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:43,192
Mr. Strauss.

151
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:44,526
It's pronounced "straws."

152
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:46,895
Oh-ppenheimer, Oppenheimer.

153
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,797
Whatever way you say it, they know I'm Jewish.

154
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:50,299
(Strauss chuckles)

155
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,935
I'm president of Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan.

156
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,237
"Straws" is just the Southern pronunciation.

157
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,305
-Ah. -Anyway,

158
00:09:56,338 --> 00:09:57,773
welcome to the Institute.

159
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,441
I think you could be very happy here.

160
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,410
Yes, well, you'll love the commute.

161
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:02,778
The position comes with that house

162
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,279
for you and your wife

163
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,482
and your, is it two children?

164
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:07,316
Yes, two.

165
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:10,285
I'm a great admirer of your work.

166
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,521
And you're a physicist by training, Mr. Strauss?

167
00:10:12,554 --> 00:10:14,623
I'm sorry, uh, common room 4:00 tea.

168
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,426
No, I'm not trained in physics or anything else.

169
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,294
-I'm a self-made man. -Ah.

170
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,330
-I can relate to that. -Really?

171
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:23,699
Yes, my father was one.

172
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:27,302
And this would be your office.

173
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:38,414
I'm told he's there most afternoons.

174
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,549
You know, I've always wondered

175
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:44,186
why you didn't involve him in the Manhattan Project.

176
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:48,457
Greatest scientific mind of our time.

177
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,359
Of his time.

178
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:52,428
Einstein published his Theory of Relativity

179
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:55,397
more than 40 years ago now.

180
00:10:56,465 --> 00:10:58,901
But never embraced the quantum world it revealed.

181
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:00,469
"God doesn't play dice."

182
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:02,471
Precisely.

183
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:05,307
You never thought of studying physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

184
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,710
Well, I had offers, but I chose to sell shoes.

185
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:11,246
Lewis Strauss was once a lowly shoe salesman.

186
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:13,916
No, just a shoe salesman.

187
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:16,218
Huh.

188
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:20,255
-I'd love to introduce you. -No need.

189
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:22,825
I have known him for years.

190
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,800
(soft music continues)

191
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:45,748
Albert.

192
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:48,817
(pensive music playing)

193
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:54,556
What was that? What did you say to him?

194
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:57,726
Oh, he's fine.

195
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,898
Mr. Strauss, there are things in my past

196
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,433
you ought to be aware of.

197
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,368
Well, as chairman of the AEC,

198
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:07,870
I have access to your security file.

199
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:08,904
I've read it.

200
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,506
-You're not worried? -No.

201
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:11,907
Why would I be worried after everything

202
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,408
you've done for your country?

203
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,910
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

204
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,779
Well, the purpose of this institute

205
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:19,481
is to provide a haven for independent minds.

206
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:23,418
That's you. You are the man for the job.

207
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,055
Well, then I'll consider it.

208
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,357
I'll see you at the AEC meeting tomorrow.

209
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,728
(scoffs)

210
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:34,329
This is one of the most prestigious appointments in the country.

211
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:36,099
appointments in the country.

212
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,333
Yes, with a great commute.

213
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,669
That's why I'm considering it.

214
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:42,471
SENATOR McGEE: <i>So, Dr. Oppenheimer brought</i>

215
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:44,907
<i>your attention</i> <i>to his past associations</i>

216
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,075
<i>before you appointed him?</i>

217
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:47,543
Yes.

218
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:49,411
And it didn't concern you?

219
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,979
Just then, I was entirely consumed with

220
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:54,783
with what he must have said to Einstein to sour him on me.

221
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,319
(laughter)

222
00:12:58,387 --> 00:12:59,588
But later?

223
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:01,557
Well, we all know what happened later.

224
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,959
Doctor, your, uh... your time in Europe,

225
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,561
you seemed to meet with a wide range

226
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:07,029
of other countries' physicists.

227
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:08,064
Yes, that's right.

228
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:10,365
Any Russians?

229
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:12,868
None that spring to mind.

230
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:15,804
If you'll just allow me to continue with my statement...

231
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,807
Mr. Robb, you'll have ample opportunity to cross-examine.

232
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:23,979
After Göttingen, I moved on to Leiden in Holland

233
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,050
<i>where I first met Isidor Rabi.</i>

234
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,585
(clears throat) Excuse me.

235
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:30,719
(grunts)

236
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:33,488
(sighs)

237
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,858
A Yank, lecturing on the new physics?

238
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:36,959
This I have to hear.

239
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:39,027
I'm an American myself.

240
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:40,562
How surprising.

241
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:41,663
Um...

242
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,966
Let me know if you need any help with the English.

243
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,403
(scattered laughter)

244
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:53,642
(speaking Dutch)

245
00:13:57,946 --> 00:13:59,915
Wait, what's he saying?

246
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:05,520
(door opens)

247
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:09,524
(Rabi grunts)

248
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:11,493
No, thank you.

249
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:13,495
It's a long way to Zurich.

250
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:15,164
You get any skinnier, we're gonna lose you

251
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:17,032
between the seat cushions.

252
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,101
I'm Rabi.

253
00:14:18,134 --> 00:14:19,501
Oppenheimer.

254
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:21,570
I caught your lecture on molecules.

255
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:22,738
Caught some of it.

256
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:26,041
We're a couple of New York Jews. How do you know Dutch?

257
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,643
Well, I thought I'd better learn it

258
00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:28,844
when I got here this semester.

259
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:30,479
You learned enough Dutch in six weeks

260
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:32,215
to give a lecture on quantum mechanics?

261
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:33,749
Wanted to challenge myself.

262
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:36,152
Quantum physics wasn't challenging enough.

263
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:37,920
<i>-Schvitzer.</i> <i>-Schvitzer?</i>

264
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:39,855
-Show-off. -(chuckles)

265
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:41,723
Dutch in six weeks, but you never learned Yiddish?

266
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,825
They don't speak it so much my side of the park.

267
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:44,927
Screw you.

268
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:47,529
You homesick?

269
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:48,964
Oh, you know it.

270
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,935
Ever get the feeling our kind isn't entirely welcome here?

271
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:54,036
Physicists?

272
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,570
'S funny.

273
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,673
Not in the department.

274
00:14:57,706 --> 00:14:59,007
They're all Jewish too.

275
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,511
Eat.

276
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:06,949
There's a German you have to seek out.

277
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:10,519
-Heisenberg. -Right.

278
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:14,923
(Heisenberg speaking German)

279
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:21,197
One might be led to the presumption

280
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,699
that behind the quantum world,

281
00:15:23,732 --> 00:15:27,602
there still hides a real world in which causality holds,

282
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,838
but such speculation seem to us,

283
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:32,607
to say it explicitly, fruitless. Thank you.

284
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,077
Have a great day.

285
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:39,248
(indistinct chatter)

286
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:40,983
-Wonderful. -Thank you.

287
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:42,251
Dr. Oppenheimer.

288
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:44,220
Oppenheimer, yes.

289
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:46,122
I liked your paper on molecules.

290
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,656
Probably because you inspired it.

291
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:49,192
If I inspire anything else, let me know.

292
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:50,259
We could publish together.

293
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:52,128
I have to get back to America.

294
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,895
Why? There's no one there

295
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:56,132
taking quantum mechanics seriously.

296
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,766
-That's exactly why. -(sighs)

297
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:00,236
He's pining for the canyons of Manhattan.

298
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,704
Canyons of New Mexico.

299
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:03,872
-You're from New Mexico? -No.

300
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:06,008
New York, but my brother and I have a ranch

301
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,144
outside Santa Fe. (inhales)

302
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,545
That's the America I miss right now.

303
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:12,647
Then it's best you get home, cowboys.

304
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,283
-(Robert chuckles) -(chuckles) That's him.

305
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:17,753
No, me and horses. I don't think so.

306
00:16:17,786 --> 00:16:19,921
-(Rabi chuckles) -Nice to meet you.

307
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:23,792
Did you ever encounter Heisenberg again?

308
00:16:23,825 --> 00:16:26,728
Not in person, no, but, uh...

309
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:30,066
...you might say our paths crossed.

310
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,835
On returning to America, I accepted positions

311
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,605
at both Caltech and up at Berkeley.

312
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:38,840
(indistinct chatter)

313
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:41,943
I got it, it's all right.

314
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,080
(mellow music playing)

315
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:02,697
Dr. Lawrence, I presume?

316
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,334
You must be Oppenheimer.

317
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:06,902
Yes.

318
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:09,272
I hear you want to start a school of quantum theory.

319
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:10,972
I am starting it. Next door.

320
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:12,841
-They put you in there? -I asked for it.

321
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:14,943
Wanted to be close to you experimentalists.

322
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:17,346
Theory will get you only so far, huh?

323
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,348
We're building a machine to accelerate electrons.

324
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:22,085
-Magnificent. -Would you like to help?

325
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,952
Build it? Oh, no. (chuckles)

326
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:25,088
No, no.

327
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:27,689
But I am working on theories I'd like to test with it.

328
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:28,723
When do you start teaching?

329
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,625
I've got my first in an hour.

330
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:32,661
-Seminar? -Pupil.

331
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:35,931
One student? That's it?

332
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:38,700
I'm teaching something no one here has dreamt of.

333
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,735
But once people start hearing what you can do with it...

334
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,238
There's no going back.

335
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,373
(door opens)

336
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:46,708
-Oh. I must have missed the... -Ah. Lo...

337
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:48,743
-Mr. Lomanitz? -Na.

338
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:50,846
Yeah.

339
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:52,981
Yes, this is it. Please.

340
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:54,083
Take a seat.

341
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:56,618
(clears throat)

342
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,755
What do you know about quantum mechanics?

343
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,159
I have a grasp on the basics.

344
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:04,759
Then you're doing it wrong.

345
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:05,961
(classical music playing)

346
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:08,264
Is light made up of particles or waves?

347
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:09,432
Quantum mechanics says it's both.

348
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,067
How could it be both?

349
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,001
-It can't. -It can't.

350
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:17,906
But it is. It's paradoxical, and yet, it works.

351
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:26,048
Now.

352
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,885
Thank you.

353
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:32,921
Mr. Lomanitz. You're gonna be okay.

354
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:34,323
Mr. Snyder.

355
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:35,891
Now let's consider a star.

356
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:39,462
A star. A vast furnace burning in outer space,

357
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:42,898
fire pushing outwards against its own gravity.

358
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,367
Balanced.

359
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,701
But if that furnace cools...

360
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:48,036
(crackling)

361
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,072
...and gravity starts winning, it contracts.

362
00:18:51,073 --> 00:18:52,040
Density increases.

363
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,276
Correct.

364
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:54,477
Increasing gravity.

365
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,011
Increasing density.

366
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:58,181
-And? -It's a vicious cycle until...

367
00:18:58,214 --> 00:18:59,848
what's the limit here?

368
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,252
(chuckles) I don't know. See where the math takes us.

369
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:05,054
I guarantee it's somewhere no one's been before.

370
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,988
Me?

371
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,192
Yes, you. Your math is better than mine.

372
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:10,892
(students laughing)

373
00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:13,028
SENATOR BARTLETT: <i>Dr. Oppenheimer's file</i>

374
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:15,464
<i>contained detail</i> <i>of his activities in Berkeley.</i>

375
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:16,965
Why would they have started a file

376
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:19,935
on Dr. Oppenheimer before the war?

377
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:22,438
Well, you'd have to ask Mr. Hoover.

378
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:24,340
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

379
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:27,310
Uh, my assumption is that

380
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:30,479
it was connected to his, uh,

381
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:33,049
left-wing political activities.

382
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,817
You shouldn't let them bring up politics

383
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,186
in the classroom, Oppie.

384
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,954
I wrote that.

385
00:19:38,987 --> 00:19:42,258
Lawrence, you embrace the revolution in physics.

386
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,093
Can't you see it everywhere else?

387
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:46,229
Picasso, Stravinsky, Freud, Marx.

388
00:19:46,262 --> 00:19:47,862
Well, this is America, Oppie.

389
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,265
We had our revolution.

390
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,901
Seriously, keep it out of the lab.

391
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:56,037
Well, out of the lab, my landlady

392
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:58,873
is having a discussion group tonight. Interested?

393
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,976
I have sampled the Berkeley political scene.

394
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:03,045
It's all just philosophy post-grads

395
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:05,381
and Communists talking integration.

396
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,083
You don't care about integration.

397
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:08,984
I want to vote for it, not talk about it.

398
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:11,019
'Specially on a Friday. Come on, let's eat.

399
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:13,389
(sighs) I'm meeting my brother there.

400
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,291
SENATOR BARTLETT: <i>And how would these activities</i>

401
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:16,459
<i>have come to the attention</i>

402
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:17,493
of the FBI?

403
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:19,495
Well, if I remember correctly,

404
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:21,464
the FBI was taking license plates

405
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:23,832
outside suspected Communist gatherings,

406
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,867
<i>and his name popped up.</i>

407
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:34,976
-Gotcha! -(whispers): Jesus Christ.

408
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,313
-Sorry. Hi, brother. -Frank.

409
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:40,049
Uh, you remember Jackie.

410
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:41,550
Evening.

411
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:43,552
Let's go. Come.

412
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:46,155
Right over there, right over there.

413
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:50,092
Robert. I want you to meet Chevalier.

414
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:53,828
Dr. Haakon Chevalier, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

415
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:55,030
-Pleasure. -Pleasure.

416
00:20:55,064 --> 00:20:56,365
This is my little brother, Frank.

417
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:57,600
-And this is... -Hello.

418
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,568
-Still Jackie. -Hello, Still Jackie.

419
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:01,570
Chevalier, you're in languages?

420
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:03,339
And your reputation precedes you.

421
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:05,107
-What have you heard? -MARY: Excuse me.

422
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:06,908
That you're teaching a radical new approach to physics

423
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:08,177
I have no chance of understanding,

424
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,578
but I hadn't heard you're a Party member.

425
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:11,913
-Uh, I'm not. -Oh, not yet.

426
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:13,915
Frank and I are thinking of joining. Just the other day,

427
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:15,584
-I was saying... -I support a range of causes.

428
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:17,253
The Spanish Civil War?

429
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:19,020
A democratic republic being overthrown

430
00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:20,356
by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?

431
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:22,058
Our government.

432
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:23,559
They think that socialism is a bigger threat than fascism.

433
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:25,094
Not for long.

434
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:26,928
Look at what the Nazis are doing to the Jews.

435
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:29,532
I send funds to colleagues in Germany to emigrate.

436
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:31,600
I have to do something.

437
00:21:31,634 --> 00:21:35,003
(sighs) My own work is so abstract.

438
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:36,605
What are you working on?

439
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,574
What happens to the stars when they die.

440
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:40,041
Do stars die?

441
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:42,545
Well, if they do,

442
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:44,480
they'd cool, then collapse.

443
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:47,149
In fact, the bigger the star,

444
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:49,884
<i>-the more violent its demise.</i> -(explosions)

445
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:51,454
The gravity gets so concentrated

446
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:54,457
it swallows everything.

447
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,458
Everything, even light.

448
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:56,659
Can that really happen?

449
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,494
The math says it can.

450
00:21:58,527 --> 00:21:59,961
If we can get published,

451
00:21:59,994 --> 00:22:01,564
then perhaps one day, an astronomer finds one.

452
00:22:01,597 --> 00:22:03,332
But right now, all I have is theory,

453
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:05,234
which can't impact people's lives.

454
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:07,536
Well, if you're going to send money to Spain,

455
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,138
do it through the Communist Party.

456
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:10,506
They can get it to the front lines.

457
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,941
Mary sent me with these.

458
00:22:13,642 --> 00:22:16,445
-I'm Jean. -Robert.

459
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,979
Haakon Chevalier.

460
00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:19,548
The union meeting at Serber's last month?

461
00:22:19,582 --> 00:22:20,982
Right, right, yes.

462
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:22,385
Oh, thank you.

463
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:24,653
Robert here says he's not a Communist.

464
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:26,988
Well, then he doesn't know enough about it.

465
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:29,392
Oh, I've read <i>Das Kapital,</i> all three volumes.

466
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:31,060
Does that count?

467
00:22:31,093 --> 00:22:33,062
It would make you better read than most party members.

468
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:35,398
Turgid stuff. There's some thinking, um,

469
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:36,599
"Ownership is theft."

470
00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:38,534
-"Property." -"Property"?

471
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,369
"Property," not "ownership."

472
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:42,438
I'm sorry, I read it in the original German.

473
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:45,141
(chuckles) Well.

474
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:47,376
It's not about the book.

475
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,413
It's about the ideas. And you sound uncommitted.

476
00:22:50,446 --> 00:22:52,081
Well, I'm committed to thinking freely

477
00:22:52,114 --> 00:22:54,550
about how to improve our world.

478
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,685
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

479
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:59,688
You're a physicist, you pick and choose rules?

480
00:22:59,722 --> 00:23:01,290
Or do you use the discipline

481
00:23:01,323 --> 00:23:03,459
to channel your energies into progress?

482
00:23:03,492 --> 00:23:05,895
I like a little wiggle room.

483
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:09,198
Do you always tow the party line?

484
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:12,334
I like my wiggle room too.

485
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:16,238
(Jean breathing heavily)

486
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:21,310
(exhales deeply)

487
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:25,013
-ROBERT: What? -(chuckles)

488
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:26,215
Wait, wait, wait.

489
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,720
Unexpected.

490
00:23:31,754 --> 00:23:33,656
-What? -For a physicist.

491
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:36,459
You only have a shelf full of Freud?

492
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:39,361
Well, actually, my background's more...

493
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:41,230
Uh, Jungian?

494
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:43,466
You know analysis?

495
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:46,034
When I was in post-grad at Cambridge,

496
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,369
I had a little trouble.

497
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,106
-I'll bite. -I tried to poison my tutor.

498
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,141
Did you hate him?

499
00:23:52,174 --> 00:23:53,642
I liked him very much.

500
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:55,578
You just needed to get laid.

501
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:57,179
Took my analyst two years,

502
00:23:57,213 --> 00:23:59,148
and I don't think they ever put it that succinctly.

503
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:00,516
You have everyone convinced

504
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:03,285
you're more complicated than you actually are.

505
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,321
We're all simple souls, I guess.

506
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:06,522
I'm not.

507
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:10,426
What's this?

508
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:12,026
Sanskrit.

509
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:13,362
You can read this?

510
00:24:13,395 --> 00:24:15,197
I'm learning.

511
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:21,203
Read this.

512
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:24,273
Well, in this part,

513
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:26,509
Vishnu reveals his multi-armed self...

514
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:27,543
No.

515
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:30,479
Read the words.

516
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:37,018
"And now I am become Death.

517
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:44,193
Destroyer of worlds."

518
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:46,629
(thunder rumbling)

519
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:50,432
(wind howling)

520
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:54,236
(disquieting music playing)

521
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:11,086
(thunder rumbling)

522
00:25:15,124 --> 00:25:16,458
This'll do. (clicks tongue)

523
00:25:22,598 --> 00:25:24,199
It'll break before dawn.

524
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:27,603
Air cools overnight, just before dawn, it breaks.

525
00:25:30,272 --> 00:25:32,207
(clicks tongue) Come.

526
00:25:33,342 --> 00:25:35,544
(laughter)

527
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:41,717
Ah. So, I'm getting married.

528
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,352
-Frank. Congratulations! -Thank you.

529
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:45,187
-Thank you. -To Jackie?

530
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,590
-Yeah, to Jackie. -(clears throat)

531
00:25:47,623 --> 00:25:48,724
The waitress.

532
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,726
Oppie, you're right. It's lettin' up.

533
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,195
I'm gonna go see if there's any stars.

534
00:25:53,228 --> 00:25:55,264
All your talk about the common man,

535
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:56,799
but Jackie's not good enough for you, hmm?

536
00:25:56,832 --> 00:25:57,866
Mm-mm.

537
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,401
We join the Party and you can't

538
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:01,203
-hide your disapproval. Why? -Oh, now, I...

539
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:02,304
Is that because that's supposed to be your thing?

540
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:03,872
I haven't joined the Party, Frank.

541
00:26:03,906 --> 00:26:06,442
And I don't think she should have convinced you to either.

542
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:08,210
Half of the faculty is Communist.

543
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:09,311
Not that half.

544
00:26:10,646 --> 00:26:13,382
I'm your brother, Frank, and I want you to be cautious.

545
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:15,117
And I want to wring your neck.

546
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:17,486
(breath shudders)

547
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,422
I won't live my life afraid to make a mistake.

548
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,628
You're happy, I'm happy.

549
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:27,196
So then I'm happy you're happy

550
00:26:27,229 --> 00:26:28,564
-that I'm happy. -(chuckles)

551
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:32,801
(mysterious music playing)

552
00:26:32,835 --> 00:26:34,436
I feel like I could see

553
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,572
one of those dark stars that you're working on.

554
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:39,174
You can't. That's the whole point.

555
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:41,543
Their gravity swallows light.

556
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,881
It's like a kind of hole in space.

557
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:47,249
Is Frank okay?

558
00:26:47,282 --> 00:26:49,685
Yes. He just has a shitty brother.

559
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:52,488
It is special here.

560
00:26:54,857 --> 00:26:57,326
When I was a kid,

561
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:00,396
I thought if I could find a way

562
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:04,800
to combine physics and New Mexico,

563
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,369
my life would be perfect. (laughs)

564
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:09,705
Little remote for that.

565
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:10,873
Yes.

566
00:27:10,906 --> 00:27:12,574
Let's get some sleep.

567
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:14,943
That mesa we saw today,

568
00:27:14,977 --> 00:27:17,479
one of my favorite places in the world.

569
00:27:18,313 --> 00:27:19,782
And tomorrow we'll climb it.

570
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:21,250
What's it called?

571
00:27:22,284 --> 00:27:24,353
Los Alamos.

572
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:29,458
I didn't expect to see you today.

573
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:32,461
Do I have to make an appointment?

574
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:36,532
Hey! Hey, get back here!

575
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:37,700
Alvarez?

576
00:27:43,472 --> 00:27:46,308
Oppie! Oppie!

577
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:48,343
What? What is it?

578
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:49,978
They've done it. They've done it.

579
00:27:50,012 --> 00:27:51,280
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.

580
00:27:51,313 --> 00:27:53,482
They split the uranium nucleus.

581
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:56,218
How?

582
00:27:56,952 --> 00:27:58,854
Bombard it with neutrons.

583
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:00,022
It's a nuclear fission.

584
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:01,690
They did it, they split the atom.

585
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:03,292
It's not possible.

586
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:05,627
(stimulating music playing)

587
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:11,233
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

588
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:19,808
See? Can't be done.

589
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,313
Very elegant. Quite clear.

590
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:26,982
-There's just one problem. -Where?

591
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:28,817
Next door.

592
00:28:28,851 --> 00:28:30,786
Alvarez did it.

593
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,955
-But then look... -(pulsing)

594
00:28:32,988 --> 00:28:36,325
...these fission pulses, they're massive.

595
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:39,628
I've seen 30 of these in the past ten minutes.

596
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:42,498
Theory will take you only so far.

597
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:43,966
(gasps)

598
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:46,001
During the process...

599
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,770
extra neutrons boil off,

600
00:28:47,803 --> 00:28:50,973
which could be used to split other uranium atoms.

601
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:52,407
Chain reaction.

602
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:54,077
You're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'.

603
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,879
You, me, and every other physicist around the world

604
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:58,413
who's seen the news.

605
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:00,916
I'm... what? What are we all thinking?

606
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:04,720
A bomb, Alvarez.

607
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:07,589
A bomb.

608
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:10,826
I told you, Robert, no more fucking flowers.

609
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:13,962
I don't understand what you want from me.

610
00:29:13,996 --> 00:29:15,764
I don't want anything from you.

611
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:18,801
Well, you say that and then you call.

612
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:21,436
Well, don't answer.

613
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,472
I'll always answer.

614
00:29:28,744 --> 00:29:29,678
Fine.

615
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:32,414
Just no more flowers. (breathing heavily)

616
00:29:33,448 --> 00:29:34,817
You're not coming?

617
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,787
You have to know when you're beaten, Robert.

618
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,825
It's not that simple, Hoke.

619
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:45,027
Chevalier, good to see you. It's...

620
00:29:45,061 --> 00:29:46,395
Ah, Barbara, good to see you

621
00:29:46,428 --> 00:29:48,897
and the illustrious Dr. Oppenheimer.

622
00:29:48,931 --> 00:29:50,099
I'm Eltenton.

623
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:51,500
-ROBERT: Oh, pleasure. -Please, please.

624
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:52,701
Now, might you say a word

625
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:55,470
about organized labor on campuses, yes?

626
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:57,039
Coming through! Coming through!

627
00:29:57,073 --> 00:29:58,640
-(chanting): F.A.E.C.T.! -I work at Shell.

628
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:00,676
We've signed up chemists, we've signed up engineers,

629
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:02,578
so why not scientists in academia?

630
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:05,514
(chanting): Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

631
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:08,817
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

632
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:10,485
Oppie! Oppie!

633
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,422
-Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! -(cheers and applause)

634
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:20,562
Teachers are unionized. Why not professors?

635
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:22,030
Don't you have somewhere to be?

636
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:23,899
Lawrence, academics have rights too.

637
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:26,435
Look, it's not that. I've got a group coming.

638
00:30:26,468 --> 00:30:29,671
-Well, I'll sit in. -Not this one.

639
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:33,375
(door opens)

640
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,613
Richard. Dr. Bush.

641
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,715
What brings you two up north?

642
00:30:41,817 --> 00:30:43,886
(somber music playing)

643
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:47,556
(sighs)

644
00:30:49,192 --> 00:30:50,559
Richard, you tell Ruth

645
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:51,860
I'll be down to Pasadena Thursday.

646
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:58,767
(sighs)

647
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:03,505
STUDENT 1: Your paper on black holes is in!

648
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:05,507
-STUDENT 2: Oppie! -(applause)

649
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,178
Where's Hartland? Get Hartland. Get Hartland.

650
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:11,480
September 1st, 1939,

651
00:31:11,513 --> 00:31:13,749
the world's gonna remember this day.

652
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:14,650
(Robert chuckles)

653
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:16,152
Oh, Hartland. Our paper, it's in print.

654
00:31:16,185 --> 00:31:18,921
You've been upstaged.

655
00:31:22,524 --> 00:31:25,061
During the Battle of Britain, I found myself

656
00:31:25,094 --> 00:31:27,829
increasingly out of sympathy with the (clears throat)

657
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:30,866
policy of neutrality that Communists advocated.

658
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:34,703
Right after Hitler invaded Russia and we became allies,

659
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:36,772
these Communist sympathies, did they return?

660
00:31:36,805 --> 00:31:37,839
No.

661
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:42,577
I need to make clear that my changing views on Russia

662
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:43,845
did not mean a sharp break

663
00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:45,948
from those who held different views.

664
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:48,550
For a year or two, and during a previous marriage,

665
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:51,887
my wife Kitty had been a Communist Party member.

666
00:31:52,888 --> 00:31:54,489
(Kitty laughing)

667
00:31:54,523 --> 00:31:55,857
Oop!

668
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:57,693
This way. This is where I keep the good stuff.

669
00:31:57,726 --> 00:31:59,728
Well, I thought this was the Tolmans' house.

670
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:01,964
I live with them while I'm at Caltech.

671
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:03,498
Do you two need anything?

672
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:05,000
We're good, Ruthie.

673
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:08,737
So, you're a biologist.

674
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,974
Well, somehow I have graduated to housewife.

675
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:15,144
Can you explain quantum mechanics to me?

676
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:16,212
Seems baffling.

677
00:32:16,245 --> 00:32:17,946
Yes, it is.

678
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:21,850
Well, this glass,

679
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:22,784
this drink...

680
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:25,921
-(knocks countertop) -...this countertop,

681
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:29,058
uh, our bodies...

682
00:32:29,092 --> 00:32:30,993
all of it.

683
00:32:31,026 --> 00:32:33,595
It's mostly empty space.

684
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:36,132
Groupings of tiny energy waves bound together.

685
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:38,033
By what?

686
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:41,636
Forces of attraction strong enough to convince us

687
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,872
that matter is solid.

688
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:47,042
Stop my body passing through yours.

689
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:54,616
(indistinct chatter)

690
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:00,289
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

691
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:02,058
Not very.

692
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:07,796
There is someone that I feel...

693
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:09,265
Does she feel the same way?

694
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:13,136
Sometimes. Not enough.

695
00:33:14,337 --> 00:33:17,306
You know, I'm going to New Mexico.

696
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,142
To my ranch, with friends.

697
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:20,542
You should come.

698
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:23,179
I meant with your husband.

699
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:24,780
Yes, you did.

700
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:27,716
'Cause you know it won't make a bit of difference.

701
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:29,951
(sentimental music playing)

702
00:33:31,686 --> 00:33:33,189
Why did you marry him?

703
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:36,758
I was lost and he was kind.

704
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:39,795
Lost?

705
00:33:39,828 --> 00:33:43,332
Well, my previous husband had died, and...

706
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:45,801
at 28, I wasn't really ready to be a widow.

707
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,836
-Who was your first husband? -Nobody.

708
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:50,339
But my second husband was Joe Dallet.

709
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:53,342
He was, um, from money, like me, but...

710
00:33:53,376 --> 00:33:56,312
he was a union organizer in Youngstown, Ohio.

711
00:33:56,345 --> 00:33:57,612
Fell hard.

712
00:33:57,646 --> 00:33:58,914
(chuckles) How hard?

713
00:33:58,947 --> 00:34:00,615
Hard enough to spend the next four years

714
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:01,983
living off beans and pancakes,

715
00:34:02,017 --> 00:34:04,786
handing out the <i>Daily Worker</i> at factory gates.

716
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,323
By 36, I just told Joe I couldn't take it anymore.

717
00:34:07,356 --> 00:34:09,225
Quit the Party and a year later,

718
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:12,794
I wanted him back, so... Him, not the <i>Daily Worker.</i>

719
00:34:12,828 --> 00:34:14,963
And he said, "Swell, I'll meet you on my way to Spain."

720
00:34:14,996 --> 00:34:16,698
He went to fight for the Loyalists?

721
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:18,834
And then he went to the brigades and I waited.

722
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:19,935
And...

723
00:34:20,802 --> 00:34:22,171
Joe got himself killed

724
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:24,606
first time he popped his head out of the trench.

725
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:28,377
Ideology got Joe killed. For nothing.

726
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:30,279
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

727
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:31,414
My husband offered both our futures

728
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:32,914
to stop one fascist bullet

729
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:35,118
from embedding itself in a mudbank.

730
00:34:36,017 --> 00:34:37,853
That's the definition of nothing.

731
00:34:37,886 --> 00:34:39,888
Seems a little reductive.

732
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:41,656
Pragmatic.

733
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,127
Now here I am.

734
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:47,963
Wherever the hell this is.

735
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:52,168
(sentimental music continues)

736
00:34:55,003 --> 00:34:58,274
I didn't want you to hear it from anyone else.

737
00:34:58,307 --> 00:35:00,675
(crying softly)

738
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:04,046
Least you didn't bring me flowers. (sniffles)

739
00:35:05,148 --> 00:35:07,283
(chuckles)

740
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:09,152
(tender music playing)

741
00:35:09,185 --> 00:35:12,754
We both know I'm not what you want, Jean.

742
00:35:13,788 --> 00:35:16,425
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

743
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:17,859
No.

744
00:35:19,428 --> 00:35:21,796
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

745
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,733
You knocked her up, fast work.

746
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:27,403
-Can't keep a good man down. -(scoffs)

747
00:35:27,436 --> 00:35:29,438
I meant her.

748
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:31,474
She knew what she wanted.

749
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:33,442
What about the husband?

750
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:34,943
We talked, um,

751
00:35:34,976 --> 00:35:36,912
they're getting a divorce, so...

752
00:35:36,945 --> 00:35:40,715
we can get married before she starts showing.

753
00:35:40,749 --> 00:35:42,218
How civilized.

754
00:35:44,187 --> 00:35:45,288
You idiot.

755
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:47,089
This is your community.

756
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:50,059
You think the rules don't apply to the golden boy?

757
00:35:51,227 --> 00:35:52,861
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

758
00:35:52,894 --> 00:35:55,398
Don't alienate the only people in the world

759
00:35:55,431 --> 00:35:57,099
that understand what you do.

760
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,203
One day you might need them.

761
00:36:00,236 --> 00:36:02,971
F.A.E.C.T. MEMBERS (chanting): F.A.E.C.T.!

762
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:04,207
The Federation of Architects,

763
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,376
Engineers, Chemists and Technicians.

764
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,910
(chanting stops)

765
00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:16,352
Lomanitz, what do you get paid a month?

766
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:17,520
That's not the point, Lawrence.

767
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:19,854
What do any of you have in common

768
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:22,491
with farm laborers and dock workers?

769
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:24,093
Plenty.

770
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:27,697
Everybody out. Now!

771
00:36:31,534 --> 00:36:32,934
Not you.

772
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:38,840
(door closes)

773
00:36:38,873 --> 00:36:39,841
What are you doing?

774
00:36:39,874 --> 00:36:41,544
It's a trade union.

775
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:43,512
Filled with Communists.

776
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:45,248
So? I haven't joined the Party.

777
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:47,383
They won't let me bring you onto the project

778
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,118
because of this shit.

779
00:36:49,151 --> 00:36:50,919
They won't even let me tell you what the project is.

780
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:53,389
Oh. (scoffs) I know what the project is.

781
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:54,490
Oh, really?

782
00:36:54,523 --> 00:36:55,824
We've all heard about Einstein

783
00:36:55,857 --> 00:36:57,126
and Szilard's letter to Roosevelt

784
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,960
warning him the Germans could make a bomb,

785
00:36:58,994 --> 00:37:01,863
and I know what it means for the Nazis to have a bomb.

786
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:03,266
Oh, and I don't?

787
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:05,934
It's not your people they're herding into camps.

788
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:08,036
It's mine.

789
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,207
You think that I tell them about your politics.

790
00:37:12,308 --> 00:37:14,876
The next time you're coming home from a meeting,

791
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:16,945
why don't you take a look in the rearview mirror?

792
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:19,048
Listen to the sounds on your phone line

793
00:37:19,081 --> 00:37:22,151
and stop being so goddamn naive.

794
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:24,986
Why would they care what I do?

795
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,988
(scoffs) Because you're not just self-important,

796
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:29,191
you're actually important.

797
00:37:30,426 --> 00:37:31,793
Okay.

798
00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:35,431
Okay. I get it.

799
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:37,533
If you could just be a little more...

800
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:39,068
Pragmatic.

801
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:40,202
I'll talk to Lomanitz, I'll talk to the others,

802
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:42,338
you don't have to worry. It's done.

803
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:44,140
Lawrence.

804
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,979
Then welcome to the war.

805
00:37:51,012 --> 00:37:53,316
I filled out my first security questionnaire

806
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:54,617
and was informed

807
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,452
that my involvement with left-wing groups

808
00:37:56,485 --> 00:38:00,423
would not prove a bar to my working on the atomic program.

809
00:38:00,456 --> 00:38:03,192
SENATOR PASTORE: <i>Why were</i> <i>his Communist associations</i>

810
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:06,329
not seen as a security risk during the war?

811
00:38:06,362 --> 00:38:08,097
Senator, I can't possibly answer

812
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,467
for security clearance granted years before I ever met the man.

813
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,502
Fine. What about after?

814
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,471
After the war, Dr. Oppenheimer

815
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:19,275
was the most respected scientific voice in the world.

816
00:38:19,308 --> 00:38:21,344
That's why I asked him to run the Institute,

817
00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:24,480
that's why he advised the Atomic Energy Commission.

818
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:25,581
Simple as that.

819
00:38:25,614 --> 00:38:28,217
What are they accusing me of?

820
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,018
I think they just want to know what happened

821
00:38:30,052 --> 00:38:32,555
between 1947 and 1954
to change your mind

822
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:34,623
on Oppenheimer's security clearance.

823
00:38:34,657 --> 00:38:37,393
I didn't. I was chair of the AEC,

824
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:40,995
but it wasn't me that brought the charges against Robert.

825
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:42,264
-Who did? -Some former staff member

826
00:38:42,298 --> 00:38:44,233
of the Joint Congressional Committee.

827
00:38:44,266 --> 00:38:47,336
He was a rabid anti-Communist named Borden.

828
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,672
He wrote to the FBI demanding they take action.

829
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:52,241
The FBI? Why not go to the AEC, direct?

830
00:38:52,274 --> 00:38:54,976
Why get caught holding the knife yourself?

831
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:57,446
What did Borden have against Oppenheimer?

832
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,315
This was the McCarthy Era.

833
00:38:59,348 --> 00:39:04,253
People hounded out of jobs for any hint of red. And then,

834
00:39:04,286 --> 00:39:05,954
<i>reading Oppenheimer's</i> <i>security file,</i>

835
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:08,157
<i>his Communist brother,</i> <i>sister-in-law,</i>

836
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,259
<i>fiancée, best friend, wife.</i>

837
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:12,628
That's before we even get to the Chevalier incident.

838
00:39:12,661 --> 00:39:16,399
But how would Borden have access to Oppenheimer's security file?

839
00:39:16,432 --> 00:39:18,100
Because somebody gave it to him.

840
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:21,936
Somebody who wanted Robert silenced.

841
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,572
-Who? -Who knows?

842
00:39:23,606 --> 00:39:26,142
Robert didn't take care not to upset

843
00:39:26,175 --> 00:39:28,411
the power brokers in Washington.

844
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:31,313
His opinions on the atom became definitive

845
00:39:31,347 --> 00:39:34,250
and he wasn't always patient with us mere mortals.

846
00:39:34,283 --> 00:39:35,451
(chuckles softly)

847
00:39:37,653 --> 00:39:40,089
I came in for plenty of harsh treatment.

848
00:39:40,122 --> 00:39:43,292
There was an AEC vote

849
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:45,294
on the export of isotopes to Norway,

850
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:48,297
<i>and they drafted in Robert</i> <i>to make me look like a fool.</i>

851
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,031
But, Dr. Oppenheimer,

852
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:52,168
we've already heard from Admiral Strauss that

853
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:55,036
these isotopes could be useful to our enemies

854
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,372
in the production of atomic weapons.

855
00:39:56,405 --> 00:39:58,274
Congressmen, you could use a shovel

856
00:39:58,307 --> 00:39:59,742
-in making atomic weapons. -(laughter)

857
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:00,975
In fact, you do.

858
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:02,545
You could use a bottle of beer

859
00:40:02,578 --> 00:40:03,978
in making atomic weapons.

860
00:40:04,012 --> 00:40:05,481
In fact, you do.

861
00:40:05,514 --> 00:40:08,451
I say isotopes are less useful than electronic components

862
00:40:08,484 --> 00:40:11,253
but more useful than a sandwich.

863
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:13,055
(all laughing)

864
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,358
<i>Genius is</i> <i>no guarantee of wisdom.</i>

865
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,129
How could this man who saw so much be so blind?

866
00:40:21,096 --> 00:40:24,467
(baby crying)

867
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:31,073
Kitty?

868
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:37,713
Kitty?

869
00:40:37,746 --> 00:40:41,150
Kitty, the project...

870
00:40:42,117 --> 00:40:44,720
I'm in. I'm in.

871
00:40:44,753 --> 00:40:46,522
Let's celebrate. (sighs)

872
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:50,759
(baby continues crying)

873
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:52,127
(Kitty moans)

874
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:53,762
Shouldn't you go to him?

875
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:55,231
(uneasy music playing)

876
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:01,537
I have been going to him all fucking day.

877
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,348
(baby crying)

878
00:41:16,552 --> 00:41:18,554
(shushing)

879
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:20,021
(knock at door)

880
00:41:25,294 --> 00:41:27,028
Come here, darling.

881
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,698
I don't know how to say this.

882
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:32,434
I'm... I'm ashamed to ask.

883
00:41:32,468 --> 00:41:34,403
Anything.

884
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:35,237
Take Peter.

885
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:38,307
-Sure. -No, for-for a while, Hoke.

886
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,309
A while.

887
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:43,679
Does Kitty know you're here?

888
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:45,447
Yes, of course she knows.

889
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:48,317
Of course she knows. (sighs)

890
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:52,054
We're awful people. Selfish, awful people.

891
00:41:53,556 --> 00:41:54,557
Forget I asked.

892
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,425
Selfish, awful people,

893
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,861
they don't know they're selfish and awful.

894
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:01,463
Sit, sit, sit.

895
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:06,602
Robert, you see beyond the world we live in.

896
00:42:08,304 --> 00:42:10,873
There is a price to be paid for that.

897
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,474
Of course we'll help you.

898
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:16,312
(wistful music playing)

899
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:25,588
Everything's changing, Robert.

900
00:42:25,621 --> 00:42:27,590
Having a child was always going to change...

901
00:42:27,623 --> 00:42:31,727
No, the world, it's pivoting in some new direction.

902
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,163
It's reforming.

903
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,633
This is your moment.

904
00:42:38,801 --> 00:42:40,469
We're putting together a group to study feasibility...

905
00:42:40,502 --> 00:42:43,305
"We" shouldn't be doing anything. You should.

906
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:46,342
Lawrence won't get this done.

907
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,510
Or Tolman or Rabi. You will.

908
00:42:51,747 --> 00:42:53,382
(indistinct chatter)

909
00:42:57,353 --> 00:42:59,488
Who are the uniforms?

910
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:02,191
I thought you might know.

911
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:05,494
-(door opens) -MAN: Dr. Oppenheimer.

912
00:43:05,527 --> 00:43:07,496
I'm Colonel Groves.

913
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:09,765
This is Lieutenant Colonel Nichols.

914
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:11,300
Have that dry-cleaned.

915
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,172
(door opens, closes)

916
00:43:17,206 --> 00:43:19,274
Well, if that's how you treat Lieutenant Colonel,

917
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:22,678
I'd hate to see how you treat a humble physicist.

918
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:24,780
Ah, if I ever meet one, I'll let you know.

919
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:26,315
(chuckles softly) Ouch.

920
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:27,916
Theaters of combat all over the world,

921
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,885
but I have to stay in Washington.

922
00:43:29,918 --> 00:43:32,621
-Why? -I built the Pentagon.

923
00:43:32,655 --> 00:43:35,290
The brass likes it so much they made me take over

924
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:37,459
the Manhattan Engineer District.

925
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:38,627
Which is?

926
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:41,930
Oh, don't be a smart ass. You know damn well what it is.

927
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:43,666
You and half of every physics department

928
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:46,535
across the country. That's problem number one.

929
00:43:46,568 --> 00:43:48,303
I thought problem number one would be

930
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:49,605
securing enough uranium ore.

931
00:43:49,638 --> 00:43:52,741
1,200 tons bought the day I took charge.

932
00:43:52,775 --> 00:43:53,942
Processing?

933
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:56,178
Just broke ground at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

934
00:43:56,979 --> 00:43:58,681
Now I'm looking for a project director.

935
00:43:58,714 --> 00:44:00,816
And my name came up?

936
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:01,917
Nope.

937
00:44:03,053 --> 00:44:05,287
Even though you brought quantum physics to America.

938
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,689
Which made me curious.

939
00:44:06,722 --> 00:44:08,590
What have you found out?

940
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:11,994
You're a dilettante, a womanizer,

941
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:13,362
a suspected Communist...

942
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:14,797
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

943
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,432
I said "suspected."

944
00:44:16,465 --> 00:44:20,703
Unstable, theatrical, egotistical, neurotic...

945
00:44:20,736 --> 00:44:21,770
Nothing good, no?

946
00:44:21,804 --> 00:44:23,472
Not even "he's brilliant, but..."

947
00:44:23,505 --> 00:44:25,307
Well, brilliance is taken for granted in your circle, so no.

948
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,842
in your circle, so no.

949
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,844
No, the only person who had anything good to say

950
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:30,612
was Richard Tolman.

951
00:44:30,646 --> 00:44:32,748
Tolman thinks you have integrity,

952
00:44:32,781 --> 00:44:34,917
but he also strikes me as a guy who knows more about science than people.

953
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,319
who knows more about science than people.

954
00:44:37,352 --> 00:44:41,323
Yet here you are. You don't take much on trust.

955
00:44:41,356 --> 00:44:43,358
I don't take anything on trust.

956
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:48,664
Why don't you have a Nobel Prize?

957
00:44:48,697 --> 00:44:49,765
Why aren't you a general?

958
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:50,966
They're making me one for this.

959
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:52,367
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

960
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:54,002
A Nobel Prize for making a bomb?

961
00:44:54,036 --> 00:44:56,371
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

962
00:44:58,807 --> 00:45:00,442
So how would you proceed?

963
00:45:01,944 --> 00:45:04,646
You're talking about turning theory

964
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,849
into a practical weapons system

965
00:45:06,882 --> 00:45:08,016
faster than the Nazis.

966
00:45:08,051 --> 00:45:09,785
Who have a 12-month head start.

967
00:45:09,818 --> 00:45:10,953
Eighteen.

968
00:45:10,986 --> 00:45:12,354
How could you possibly know that?

969
00:45:12,387 --> 00:45:14,423
Our fast neutron research took six months.

970
00:45:14,456 --> 00:45:15,958
The man they've undoubtedly put in charge will have made that leap instantly.

971
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:17,392
will have made that leap instantly.

972
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:18,627
Who do you think they put in charge?

973
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,762
Werner Heisenberg.

974
00:45:19,795 --> 00:45:22,364
He has the most intuitive understanding

975
00:45:22,397 --> 00:45:24,067
of atomic structure I have ever seen.

976
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,801
-You know his work? -I know him.

977
00:45:25,834 --> 00:45:27,669
<i>Just like I know Walther Bothe,</i> <i>von Weizsäcker, Diebner.</i>

978
00:45:27,703 --> 00:45:30,506
In a straight race, the Germans win.

979
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:33,275
-We've got one hope. -Which is?

980
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:35,511
Anti-Semitism.

981
00:45:36,645 --> 00:45:37,646
What?

982
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:40,516
Hitler called quantum physics "Jewish science."

983
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:42,384
Said it right to Einstein's face.

984
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:45,654
Our one hope is that Hitler is so... so blinded by hate

985
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:47,489
that he's denied Heisenberg proper resources,

986
00:45:47,523 --> 00:45:49,458
because it'll take vast resources.

987
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:51,026
Our nation's best scientists working together.

988
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,461
Right now, they're scattered.

989
00:45:52,494 --> 00:45:54,097
Which gives us compartmentalization.

990
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,998
All minds have to see the whole task to contribute efficiently.

991
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:57,399
to contribute efficiently.

992
00:45:57,432 --> 00:45:59,668
Poor security may cost us the race.

993
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:01,537
Inefficiency will.

994
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,405
The Germans know more than us anyway.

995
00:46:03,438 --> 00:46:05,541
The Russians don't.

996
00:46:05,574 --> 00:46:09,511
Remind me, who are we at war with?

997
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:11,980
Somebody with your past doesn't want to be seen

998
00:46:12,014 --> 00:46:13,615
downplaying the importance

999
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:16,385
of security from our Communist allies.

1000
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:19,088
Point taken. But, no.

1001
00:46:19,122 --> 00:46:21,423
(scoffs) You don't get to say "no" to me.

1002
00:46:21,456 --> 00:46:23,725
It's my job to say "no" to you when you're wrong.

1003
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:25,761
So you have the job now?

1004
00:46:25,794 --> 00:46:27,863
Uh, I'm considering it.

1005
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:32,901
I'm starting to see where you got your reputation.

1006
00:46:34,103 --> 00:46:36,538
My favorite response,

1007
00:46:36,572 --> 00:46:38,907
"Oppenheimer couldn't run a hamburger stand."

1008
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:40,843
(chuckles)

1009
00:46:40,876 --> 00:46:41,677
I couldn't.

1010
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:45,881
But I can run the Manhattan Project.

1011
00:46:46,748 --> 00:46:48,917
There's a way to balance these things.

1012
00:46:48,951 --> 00:46:53,156
Keep the Rad Lab here at Berkeley under Lawrence.

1013
00:46:53,189 --> 00:46:55,457
Met Lab in Chicago, under Szilard.

1014
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,926
Large-scale refining, where did you say? Tennessee.

1015
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,628
-And Hanford. -And Hanford.

1016
00:46:59,661 --> 00:47:03,732
All America's industrial might and scientific innovation,

1017
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:05,134
connected by rail.

1018
00:47:05,168 --> 00:47:06,835
Focused on one goal.

1019
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:09,571
One point in space and time. And it comes together here.

1020
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:11,907
<i>A secret laboratory.</i> <i>In the middle of nowhere,</i>

1021
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,408
<i>secure, self-sufficient,</i>

1022
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:14,810
equipment, housing, the works.

1023
00:47:14,843 --> 00:47:17,012
Keep everyone there until it's done.

1024
00:47:17,046 --> 00:47:19,082
It'll need a school, stores, a church.

1025
00:47:19,115 --> 00:47:20,549
Why?

1026
00:47:20,582 --> 00:47:21,884
<i>If we don't let scientists</i>

1027
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,619
bring their families, we'll never get the best.

1028
00:47:23,652 --> 00:47:25,721
You want security, build a town, build it fast.

1029
00:47:25,754 --> 00:47:26,822
Where?

1030
00:47:30,826 --> 00:47:32,794
Welcome to Los Alamos.

1031
00:47:32,828 --> 00:47:35,631
Now, there's a boys school we'll have to commandeer,

1032
00:47:35,664 --> 00:47:37,633
and the local Indians come up here for burial rites.

1033
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:40,903
But, apart from that, nothing. Forty miles. Any direction.

1034
00:47:40,936 --> 00:47:42,871
Enough to find the perfect spot.

1035
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:45,407
-For? -Success.

1036
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,944
(gripping music playing)

1037
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:52,681
Build him a town. Fast.

1038
00:47:53,715 --> 00:47:56,219
Let's go recruit some scientists.

1039
00:47:56,252 --> 00:47:58,587
Why would I leave my family?

1040
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,056
I told you, you can bring your family.

1041
00:48:00,089 --> 00:48:01,523
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

1042
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:03,659
A soldier? He's a general.

1043
00:48:03,692 --> 00:48:05,527
I've got all the soldier I need.

1044
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,130
What can I tell them?

1045
00:48:07,163 --> 00:48:09,498
Heisenberg, Diebner, Bothe and Bohr.

1046
00:48:09,531 --> 00:48:10,832
What do these men have in common?

1047
00:48:10,866 --> 00:48:12,868
The greatest minds on atomic theory.

1048
00:48:12,901 --> 00:48:14,237
-Yes, and? -Uh...

1049
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,539
As much as you like,

1050
00:48:17,572 --> 00:48:19,708
until you feel my boot on your balls.

1051
00:48:19,741 --> 00:48:22,511
You know isotopes and you know explosives

1052
00:48:22,544 --> 00:48:23,845
better than anyone in the world.

1053
00:48:23,879 --> 00:48:26,481
But you can't tell us what you're doing?

1054
00:48:26,515 --> 00:48:27,783
(Groves sighs)

1055
00:48:29,551 --> 00:48:31,787
-I don't know. -The Nazis have them.

1056
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,956
-Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen. -Under Nazi occupation.

1057
00:48:33,989 --> 00:48:35,857
Did they stop printing newspapers in Princeton?

1058
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:38,227
Why would we go to the middle of nowhere

1059
00:48:38,261 --> 00:48:39,728
for who knows how long? (chuckling)

1060
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:41,863
For a year or two. Or three.

1061
00:48:42,864 --> 00:48:46,468
Uh, General, could you give us a moment?

1062
00:48:47,536 --> 00:48:50,605
It's about unleashing the strong force...

1063
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,142
...before the Nazis do.

1064
00:48:53,176 --> 00:48:55,111
Oh, my God.

1065
00:48:55,144 --> 00:48:56,245
Niels won't work for the Nazis.

1066
00:48:56,279 --> 00:48:57,579
No, never.

1067
00:48:57,612 --> 00:48:59,915
But while they have him, we don't.

1068
00:48:59,948 --> 00:49:01,117
That's why I need you.

1069
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,119
Why would you think I'd do that?

1070
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:04,987
"Why?" "Why?"

1071
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,223
How about because this is the most important fucking thing

1072
00:49:07,256 --> 00:49:09,258
to ever happen in the history of the world.

1073
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:10,726
How about that?

1074
00:49:11,294 --> 00:49:12,728
Fuck.

1075
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:17,632
(door shuts)

1076
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:20,035
They are not gonna let me onto this project.

1077
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:22,138
And failing a security check is not gonna be good for a career, even after the war.

1078
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:23,839
for a career, even after the war.

1079
00:49:23,872 --> 00:49:26,641
So you're a fellow traveler. So what?

1080
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,043
This is a national emergency.

1081
00:49:28,077 --> 00:49:31,247
I've got some skeletons, they put me in charge.

1082
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,581
They need us.

1083
00:49:32,614 --> 00:49:34,783
Until they don't.

1084
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:40,256
Is there any chance of getting Bohr out of Denmark?

1085
00:49:40,289 --> 00:49:43,292
Nah, no dice. I checked with the British.

1086
00:49:43,326 --> 00:49:45,627
Until we get Allied boots back onto the continent,

1087
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,063
there's just no way.

1088
00:49:48,597 --> 00:49:50,032
Is he that important?

1089
00:49:50,066 --> 00:49:53,102
How many people do you know who proved Einstein wrong?

1090
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:56,272
You know, it really would be quicker to take a plane.

1091
00:49:56,305 --> 00:49:58,040
No, plane's too risky.

1092
00:49:58,074 --> 00:50:00,542
Country needs us.

1093
00:50:02,911 --> 00:50:04,012
The Harvard guys,

1094
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:06,615
they say the building's too small for the cyclotron.

1095
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,752
Get them together with the architects.

1096
00:50:13,955 --> 00:50:15,957
When's this place supposed to open?

1097
00:50:19,062 --> 00:50:19,861
Two months.

1098
00:50:20,996 --> 00:50:23,266
Robert, you're the great improviser,

1099
00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:25,334
but this... (sighs)

1100
00:50:25,368 --> 00:50:26,968
you can't do in your head.

1101
00:50:28,003 --> 00:50:29,604
Four divisions.

1102
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:34,343
Experimental, Theoretical, Metallurgical, Ordnance.

1103
00:50:34,377 --> 00:50:35,344
Who's running Theoretical?

1104
00:50:35,378 --> 00:50:36,778
I am.

1105
00:50:36,812 --> 00:50:38,013
That's what I was afraid of.

1106
00:50:38,047 --> 00:50:39,915
You're spread too thin.

1107
00:50:41,117 --> 00:50:42,818
So you take Theoretical.

1108
00:50:45,388 --> 00:50:48,623
I'm not coming here, Robert.

1109
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:55,931
Why not?

1110
00:50:59,235 --> 00:51:00,602
(scoffs)

1111
00:51:01,803 --> 00:51:05,874
You drop a bomb and it falls on the just and the unjust.

1112
00:51:05,907 --> 00:51:07,110
(sighs)

1113
00:51:07,143 --> 00:51:09,778
I don't wish the culmination of three centuries of physics

1114
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:12,215
to be a weapon of mass destruction.

1115
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:15,617
(pensive music playing)

1116
00:51:21,424 --> 00:51:22,757
Izzy.

1117
00:51:23,892 --> 00:51:28,029
I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon.

1118
00:51:29,398 --> 00:51:32,701
But I know the Nazis can't.

1119
00:51:36,105 --> 00:51:38,907
We have no choice.

1120
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:41,743
Then...

1121
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:45,448
...the second thing you'll have to do is appoint

1122
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,749
Hans Bethe to run the Theoretical division.

1123
00:51:47,782 --> 00:51:50,086
(rousing music playing)

1124
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:51,953
Wait, what was the first?

1125
00:51:51,987 --> 00:51:54,457
Take off that ridiculous uniform.

1126
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,690
You're a scientist.

1127
00:51:55,724 --> 00:51:57,326
Groves is insisting we join.

1128
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,794
Tell Groves to go shit in his hat.

1129
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:03,299
They need us for who we are. So be yourself.

1130
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:05,301
Only better.

1131
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:07,936
(rousing music continues)

1132
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,375
This is the only key.

1133
00:52:46,409 --> 00:52:47,842
And Teller's already here.

1134
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,744
-(sighs) -Shall I just show him in?

1135
00:52:49,778 --> 00:52:51,447
No, let's wait for the others.

1136
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,014
(door opens)

1137
00:52:59,388 --> 00:53:00,389
Let's get started.

1138
00:53:00,423 --> 00:53:02,491
Hello, Edward.

1139
00:53:02,525 --> 00:53:04,227
Yes.

1140
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,961
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

1141
00:53:05,994 --> 00:53:08,997
until the T-section at Los Alamos is finished.

1142
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:11,334
-Edward, can I please... -It is more important.

1143
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:15,371
When I calculated the chain reaction,

1144
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:18,107
I found a rather troubling possibility.

1145
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,243
No.

1146
00:53:20,276 --> 00:53:21,510
But this can't be right.

1147
00:53:21,544 --> 00:53:23,479
Show me how you did your calculations.

1148
00:53:23,512 --> 00:53:24,913
Yes.

1149
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:29,485
It's exponential.

1150
00:53:29,518 --> 00:53:31,987
No. No, no, no. No.

1151
00:53:34,523 --> 00:53:36,525
This is fantasy.

1152
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,827
Teller's calculations can't be right.

1153
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,530
Do them yourself while I go to Princeton.

1154
00:53:41,564 --> 00:53:43,399
-What for? -To talk to Einstein.

1155
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:46,001
Well, there's not much common ground between you two.

1156
00:53:46,034 --> 00:53:49,071
That's why I should get his view.

1157
00:53:49,105 --> 00:53:50,805
(birds chirping)

1158
00:53:52,508 --> 00:53:54,510
-Albert. -Hmm?

1159
00:53:54,543 --> 00:53:57,446
Ah. Dr. Oppenheimer. (chuckles)

1160
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,947
Well, have you met Dr. Gödel?

1161
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,549
We walk here most days.

1162
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:05,388
Trees are the most inspiring structures.

1163
00:54:05,421 --> 00:54:06,888
Albert, might I have a word?

1164
00:54:06,921 --> 00:54:10,326
Of course. 'Scuse me, Kurt.

1165
00:54:11,327 --> 00:54:14,263
You know, some days, Kurt refuses to eat.

1166
00:54:14,297 --> 00:54:15,897
Even in Princeton.

1167
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:19,034
He's convinced that the Nazis can poison his food.

1168
00:54:19,068 --> 00:54:20,336
Mm.

1169
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:22,204
Hmm? Huh.

1170
00:54:24,073 --> 00:54:25,907
Wha...

1171
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,144
(suspenseful music playing)

1172
00:54:30,446 --> 00:54:33,282
Whose... Whose work is this?

1173
00:54:33,316 --> 00:54:34,350
Teller's.

1174
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:37,952
What do you take it to mean?

1175
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:39,921
Neutrons smash into nucleus,

1176
00:54:39,954 --> 00:54:43,992
releasing neutrons to smash into other nuclei.

1177
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:46,228
Criticality, a point of no return,

1178
00:54:46,262 --> 00:54:47,862
massive explosive force.

1179
00:54:47,896 --> 00:54:50,232
But this time, the chain reaction doesn't stop.

1180
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:54,103
It would ignite the atmosphere.

1181
00:54:54,136 --> 00:54:55,137
(whooshing)

1182
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:57,139
When we detonate an atomic device,

1183
00:54:57,173 --> 00:54:59,342
we might start a chain reaction that...

1184
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:01,843
...destroys the world.

1185
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:04,913
So here we are, hmm?

1186
00:55:04,946 --> 00:55:09,251
Lost in your quantum world of probabilities

1187
00:55:09,285 --> 00:55:11,019
and needing certainty.

1188
00:55:11,053 --> 00:55:13,922
Can you run the calculations yourself?

1189
00:55:13,955 --> 00:55:15,358
(chuckles) About the only thing

1190
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:18,661
you and I have in common is a disdain for mathematics.

1191
00:55:18,694 --> 00:55:21,263
Who's working on this in-in Berkeley?

1192
00:55:21,297 --> 00:55:22,598
Hans Bethe.

1193
00:55:22,631 --> 00:55:24,467
Well, he'll get to the truth.

1194
00:55:26,102 --> 00:55:28,970
And if the truth is catastrophic?

1195
00:55:29,003 --> 00:55:30,306
Then you stop.

1196
00:55:30,339 --> 00:55:34,076
And you share your findings with the Nazis.

1197
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:37,246
So neither side destroys the world.

1198
00:55:40,449 --> 00:55:41,484
Robert.

1199
00:55:42,951 --> 00:55:46,155
This is yours, not mine.

1200
00:55:59,033 --> 00:56:00,436
Teller's wrong.

1201
00:56:00,469 --> 00:56:01,670
-He's wrong. -(shushing)

1202
00:56:01,704 --> 00:56:03,938
(keys jingling)

1203
00:56:11,347 --> 00:56:14,049
When you know Teller's critical assumptions,

1204
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:15,418
the real picture emerges.

1205
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:17,253
Bottom line?

1206
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:19,388
The chances of an uncontrolled nuclear reaction

1207
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:20,423
are near zero.

1208
00:56:20,456 --> 00:56:23,092
Near zero. (breathes heavily)

1209
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:25,394
-Oppie, this is good news. -Mm.

1210
00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:27,962
Can you run them again?

1211
00:56:27,996 --> 00:56:29,732
No, you'll get the same answer.

1212
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:31,333
Till they actually detonate one of these things,

1213
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:34,203
the best assurance you're going to get is this.

1214
00:56:34,236 --> 00:56:35,304
Near zero.

1215
00:56:37,506 --> 00:56:40,176
(exhales sharply) Theory will take you only so far.

1216
00:56:40,209 --> 00:56:41,710
-BETHE: Mm. -CHEVALIER: <i>Hello!</i>

1217
00:56:41,744 --> 00:56:43,045
-BARBARA: Hello, you. -KITTY: Hi.

1218
00:56:43,078 --> 00:56:44,413
We missed him.

1219
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:45,581
You want to adopt?

1220
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:47,015
-She's kidding. -(Kitty chuckles)

1221
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:48,983
We wanted to see you before we left.

1222
00:56:49,017 --> 00:56:52,188
-For parts unknown. -(chuckles)

1223
00:56:52,221 --> 00:56:54,757
You know who I ran into the other day?

1224
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:56,425
Eltenton.

1225
00:56:56,459 --> 00:56:57,726
Oh.

1226
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,462
The chemist from Shell? The union guy?

1227
00:56:59,495 --> 00:57:03,365
Yeah. He... The, uh, F.A.E.C.T. guy.

1228
00:57:03,399 --> 00:57:06,769
He was moaning about how we're handling the war.

1229
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:09,003
How so?

1230
00:57:09,037 --> 00:57:11,774
Lack of cooperation with our allies.

1231
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:14,143
Apparently our government's not sharing

1232
00:57:14,176 --> 00:57:16,278
any research with the Russians.

1233
00:57:16,312 --> 00:57:17,279
Well, he said,

1234
00:57:17,313 --> 00:57:20,049
"Most scientists think the policy is stupid."

1235
00:57:20,082 --> 00:57:23,352
(suspenseful music playing)

1236
00:57:23,385 --> 00:57:25,221
-ROBERT: Oh, yeah? -CHEVALIER: Yeah.

1237
00:57:25,254 --> 00:57:27,623
He mentioned that if anyone

1238
00:57:27,656 --> 00:57:30,626
had anything they wanted to pass on,

1239
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:32,495
uh, going around official channels,

1240
00:57:32,528 --> 00:57:34,463
that he could help.

1241
00:57:43,105 --> 00:57:44,773
That would be treason.

1242
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:47,643
Yes, of course.

1243
00:57:47,676 --> 00:57:49,478
I just thought you should know.

1244
00:57:52,615 --> 00:57:54,083
The brat is down.

1245
00:57:54,116 --> 00:57:55,484
Where are the martinis?

1246
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,191
Coming right up.

1247
00:58:02,224 --> 00:58:03,692
<i>Conversation ended there.</i>

1248
00:58:03,726 --> 00:58:05,828
Nothing in our long-standing friendship

1249
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:07,429
would have led me to believe

1250
00:58:07,463 --> 00:58:10,199
that Chevalier was actually seeking information,

1251
00:58:10,232 --> 00:58:12,701
and I am certain that he had no idea

1252
00:58:12,735 --> 00:58:15,036
of the work in which I was engaged.

1253
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:21,544
It has long been clear to me

1254
00:58:21,577 --> 00:58:24,280
that I should have reported this incident at once.

1255
00:58:24,313 --> 00:58:25,814
SENATOR McGEE: <i>The Oppenheimer situation</i>

1256
00:58:25,848 --> 00:58:28,751
<i>highlights the tension</i> <i>between scientists</i>

1257
00:58:28,784 --> 00:58:30,386
and the security apparatus.

1258
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:32,288
In hopes of learning how the nominee handled

1259
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:34,657
such issues during his time at the AEC,

1260
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:38,193
we'll have a scientist appearing before the committee.

1261
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:40,429
Who are they bringing in?

1262
00:58:40,462 --> 00:58:41,430
They hadn't said.

1263
00:58:41,463 --> 00:58:42,831
Mr. Chairman, if I may,

1264
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:45,401
I'm nominated for Commerce Secretary.

1265
00:58:45,434 --> 00:58:47,736
Why seek the opinion of scientists?

1266
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:50,105
This is a Cabinet post, Admiral.

1267
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:52,308
We seek a wide range of opinion.

1268
00:58:52,341 --> 00:58:55,144
Well, I'd like to know the name of the scientist testifying.

1269
00:58:55,177 --> 00:58:56,679
I'd like the chance to cross-examine.

1270
00:58:56,712 --> 00:58:58,847
This is not a court.

1271
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:01,283
(grunts) Formality, huh?

1272
00:59:01,317 --> 00:59:02,585
SENATE AIDE: No presidential Cabinet nominee

1273
00:59:02,618 --> 00:59:05,187
has failed to be confirmed since 1925.

1274
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,323
This is just how the game is played.

1275
00:59:07,356 --> 00:59:08,657
It's in the bag, Lewis.

1276
00:59:08,691 --> 00:59:09,892
So play nice.

1277
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:12,194
<i>They bring in a scientist,</i> <i>so what?</i>

1278
00:59:12,227 --> 00:59:14,229
You don't know scientists like I do, Counselor.

1279
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:16,298
They resent anyone who questions their judgment,

1280
00:59:16,332 --> 00:59:18,334
<i>especially if you're</i> <i>not one of them.</i>

1281
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:19,668
I was chair of the AEC.

1282
00:59:19,702 --> 00:59:22,137
I'm easy to blame for what happened to Robert.

1283
00:59:22,171 --> 00:59:23,472
We can't have the Senate thinking

1284
00:59:23,505 --> 00:59:26,609
the scientific community doesn't support you, sir.

1285
00:59:26,642 --> 00:59:28,477
Or should we pivot?

1286
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,479
-SENATE AIDE: To what? -And embrace it.

1287
00:59:30,512 --> 00:59:33,282
"I fought Oppenheimer, and the US won."

1288
00:59:33,315 --> 00:59:34,883
I-I don't think we need to go there.

1289
00:59:34,917 --> 00:59:37,186
Isn't there someone we can call who knows what really happened?

1290
00:59:37,219 --> 00:59:38,654
-Teller. -He'll make an impression.

1291
00:59:38,687 --> 00:59:40,756
Can you get the name of the scientist they've called?

1292
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:42,358
-Probably. -Find out if he was

1293
00:59:42,391 --> 00:59:44,760
based in Chicago or Los Alamos during the war.

1294
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:46,161
Why does that matter?

1295
00:59:46,195 --> 00:59:47,396
Well, if he was based in Chicago,

1296
00:59:47,429 --> 00:59:48,831
then he worked under Szilard and Fermi,

1297
00:59:48,864 --> 00:59:51,166
not the cult of Oppie at Los Alamos.

1298
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,434
Robert built that damn place.

1299
00:59:52,468 --> 00:59:55,237
He was founder, mayor, sheriff,

1300
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:56,672
all rolled into one.

1301
00:59:56,705 --> 00:59:59,141
(gripping music playing)

1302
01:00:04,947 --> 01:00:07,683
(baby crying)

1303
01:00:09,618 --> 01:00:11,420
All it needs is a saloon.

1304
01:00:36,378 --> 01:00:38,781
(mutters indistinctly)

1305
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:42,418
There's no kitchen.

1306
01:00:42,451 --> 01:00:46,388
Really? We'll fix that.

1307
01:00:46,422 --> 01:00:48,657
(gripping music continues)

1308
01:00:52,294 --> 01:00:55,698
Barbed wire, guns.

1309
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:56,832
Oppie.

1310
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:58,500
We're at war, Hans.

1311
01:01:00,903 --> 01:01:03,472
Halifax. 1917.

1312
01:01:03,505 --> 01:01:06,475
A cargo ship carrying munitions explodes in the harbor.

1313
01:01:06,508 --> 01:01:08,844
(explosions)

1314
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:11,814
A vast and sudden chemical reaction.

1315
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:13,716
(violent whooshing)

1316
01:01:15,484 --> 01:01:18,320
The biggest man-made explosion in history.

1317
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:20,322
Now let's calculate how much more destructive

1318
01:01:20,355 --> 01:01:23,025
it would have been if it were a nuclear

1319
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:24,727
and not a chemical reaction.

1320
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,397
Expressing power in terms of tons of TNT.

1321
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:29,932
But it will be thousands.

1322
01:01:29,965 --> 01:01:33,402
Well, then kilotons.

1323
01:01:36,972 --> 01:01:40,342
Using U-235,

1324
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,945
-the bomb will need a... -Uh-uh.

1325
01:01:42,978 --> 01:01:46,049
Sorry. Gadget will need a 33-pound sphere

1326
01:01:46,082 --> 01:01:47,549
about this size.

1327
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:51,386
Or using plutonium, the ten-pound sphere.

1328
01:01:52,788 --> 01:01:54,022
Here's the amount of uranium

1329
01:01:54,057 --> 01:01:57,392
Oak Ridge refined all of last month.

1330
01:01:59,795 --> 01:02:03,799
And the Hanford plant made this much plutonium.

1331
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:08,036
Now, if we can enrich these amounts,

1332
01:02:08,071 --> 01:02:10,873
-we need a way to detonate them. -(paper tearing)

1333
01:02:10,906 --> 01:02:13,008
Are we boring you, Edward?

1334
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:14,643
A little bit, yes.

1335
01:02:14,676 --> 01:02:15,911
May I ask why?

1336
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:17,379
We all entered this room

1337
01:02:17,412 --> 01:02:19,348
knowing a fission bomb was possible.

1338
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:21,984
How 'bout we leave it with something new?

1339
01:02:22,017 --> 01:02:23,018
Such as?

1340
01:02:23,052 --> 01:02:25,788
Instead of uranium or plutonium,

1341
01:02:25,821 --> 01:02:26,822
we use hydrogen.

1342
01:02:26,855 --> 01:02:28,357
(others murmur and laugh)

1343
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,992
-TELLER: Heavy hydrogen. -FEYNMAN: Hydrogen.

1344
01:02:30,025 --> 01:02:32,795
Deuterium. You see?

1345
01:02:32,828 --> 01:02:34,530
We compact the atoms together

1346
01:02:34,563 --> 01:02:37,633
under great pressure to induce a fusion reaction.

1347
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:41,403
Then we'll get not kilotons,

1348
01:02:41,436 --> 01:02:42,504
but megatons.

1349
01:02:42,538 --> 01:02:43,472
A big fission reaction...

1350
01:02:43,505 --> 01:02:45,074
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1351
01:02:45,108 --> 01:02:49,812
So how do you generate enough force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1352
01:02:49,845 --> 01:02:51,914
A small fission bomb.

1353
01:02:51,947 --> 01:02:53,649
There we are.

1354
01:02:53,682 --> 01:02:55,551
-(laughter) -(scattered applause)

1355
01:02:55,584 --> 01:02:57,386
Well, since we're going to need one anyway,

1356
01:02:57,419 --> 01:02:59,388
can we get back to the business at hand?

1357
01:02:59,421 --> 01:03:00,756
SENATOR BARTLETT: The isotopes issue

1358
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:04,426
wasn't your most important policy disagreement

1359
01:03:04,459 --> 01:03:06,095
with Dr. Oppenheimer.

1360
01:03:06,129 --> 01:03:08,530
It was the hydrogen bomb, wasn't it?

1361
01:03:08,564 --> 01:03:11,433
Uh, as colleagues, we agreed to disagree

1362
01:03:11,466 --> 01:03:13,468
on a great many things, uh,

1363
01:03:13,502 --> 01:03:14,736
and, well, one of them

1364
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:17,840
was the need for an H-bomb program, yes.

1365
01:03:17,873 --> 01:03:20,843
-(siren wailing) -(uneasy music playing)

1366
01:03:30,686 --> 01:03:33,455
Thanks for convening on short notice.

1367
01:03:33,488 --> 01:03:34,957
I can't believe it.

1368
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:37,492
Well, here we are.

1369
01:03:37,526 --> 01:03:39,528
Catch me up. What do we know?

1370
01:03:39,561 --> 01:03:42,065
One of our B-29s over the North Pacific

1371
01:03:42,098 --> 01:03:43,599
has detected radiation.

1372
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:45,400
Do we have the filter papers?

1373
01:03:45,434 --> 01:03:47,436
There's no doubt what this is.

1374
01:03:47,469 --> 01:03:48,670
White House says there's a doubt.

1375
01:03:48,704 --> 01:03:50,139
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1376
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:52,875
Are those the long-range detection filter papers?

1377
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:55,878
It's an atomic test.

1378
01:03:58,513 --> 01:03:59,915
The Russians have a bomb.

1379
01:03:59,948 --> 01:04:03,685
We're supposed to be years ahead of them, but some...

1380
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:06,021
What were you guys doing at Los Alamos?

1381
01:04:06,055 --> 01:04:07,190
Wasn't security tight?

1382
01:04:07,223 --> 01:04:08,724
Of course it was. You weren't there.

1383
01:04:08,757 --> 01:04:11,160
-It was... -NICHOLS: Forgive me, Doctor...

1384
01:04:11,194 --> 01:04:13,629
but I was there.

1385
01:04:14,696 --> 01:04:16,031
We can now consider

1386
01:04:16,065 --> 01:04:18,000
the actual mechanics of detonation.

1387
01:04:18,033 --> 01:04:19,168
Any ideas?

1388
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:20,936
I call this "shooting."

1389
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:24,506
We fire a chunk of fissionable material into a larger sphere

1390
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:27,042
with enough force to achieve criticality.

1391
01:04:27,076 --> 01:04:28,744
What do we think? Anyone?

1392
01:04:28,777 --> 01:04:30,579
I've been thinking about implosion.

1393
01:04:30,612 --> 01:04:32,581
Explosives around the sphere blast inwards,

1394
01:04:32,614 --> 01:04:34,650
-crushing the material. -(blasting)

1395
01:04:34,683 --> 01:04:36,618
I'd like to investigate that idea.

1396
01:04:36,652 --> 01:04:38,954
I'll talk to Ordnance, get you blowing things up.

1397
01:04:39,955 --> 01:04:41,057
Progress?

1398
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,925
Nice to see you too.

1399
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:44,726
Meet the British contingent.

1400
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,595
Dr. Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.

1401
01:04:46,628 --> 01:04:48,497
How long have you been British?

1402
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:49,731
Since Hitler told me I wasn't German.

1403
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:53,568
Uh-huh. Come, welcome to Los Alamos.

1404
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:55,470
School's up and running.

1405
01:04:55,504 --> 01:04:57,806
Bar. Always running.

1406
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,842
And I thought of a way to reduce support staff.

1407
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,812
-Is that... -ROBERT: Mrs. Serber, yes.

1408
01:05:03,845 --> 01:05:05,248
I've offered jobs to all the wives.

1409
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:06,748
Admin, librarians, computation.

1410
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:09,085
We cut down on staff, keep families together.

1411
01:05:09,118 --> 01:05:11,687
-Are these women qualified? -ROBERT: Don't be absurd.

1412
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,090
These are some of the brightest minds in our community.

1413
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:15,691
And they're already security cleared.

1414
01:05:15,724 --> 01:05:17,592
I've informed General Groves you've been holding

1415
01:05:17,626 --> 01:05:19,095
cross-divisional open discussions

1416
01:05:19,128 --> 01:05:20,829
-on a nightly basis. -Shut them down.

1417
01:05:20,862 --> 01:05:23,199
Compartmentalization is the key to maintaining security...

1418
01:05:23,232 --> 01:05:24,733
It's only the top men.

1419
01:05:24,766 --> 01:05:26,601
Who presumably communicate with subordinates.

1420
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:27,836
These men aren't stupid.

1421
01:05:27,869 --> 01:05:29,705
-They can be discreet. -I don't like it.

1422
01:05:29,738 --> 01:05:32,641
You don't like anything enough for that to be a fair test.

1423
01:05:38,181 --> 01:05:40,716
Once a week. Top men only.

1424
01:05:40,749 --> 01:05:42,118
I'd like to bring my brother here.

1425
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:43,618
No.

1426
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:46,021
Uh, Nichols...

1427
01:05:47,156 --> 01:05:49,092
I still haven't heard that my security clearance

1428
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:50,692
-has been approved. -It hasn't.

1429
01:05:50,726 --> 01:05:52,095
We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

1430
01:05:52,128 --> 01:05:53,162
No, you should wait.

1431
01:05:54,364 --> 01:05:55,465
You are aware that the Nazis have a two-year head start.

1432
01:05:55,497 --> 01:05:58,567
Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact that your security clearance

1433
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,602
is proving difficult to obtain is not my fault.

1434
01:06:00,635 --> 01:06:01,903
It's yours.

1435
01:06:01,937 --> 01:06:03,872
May not be your fault, but it's your problem.

1436
01:06:03,905 --> 01:06:04,906
Because I'm going.

1437
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:08,710
And how many people were in these, uh,

1438
01:06:08,744 --> 01:06:10,946
-open discussions? -NICHOLS: Too many.

1439
01:06:10,979 --> 01:06:12,315
Compartmentalization was supposed to be the protocol.

1440
01:06:12,348 --> 01:06:14,283
We were in a race against the Nazis.

1441
01:06:14,317 --> 01:06:16,752
And now the race is against the Soviets.

1442
01:06:16,785 --> 01:06:18,287
-Not unless we start it. -STRAUSS: Robert.

1443
01:06:18,321 --> 01:06:21,723
They just fired a starting gun.

1444
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:23,725
What's the nature of the device they detonated?

1445
01:06:23,759 --> 01:06:25,294
The data indicates it may have been

1446
01:06:25,328 --> 01:06:27,629
a plutonium implosion device.

1447
01:06:27,662 --> 01:06:30,766
Like the one you built at Los Alamos.

1448
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:32,634
The Russians have a bomb,

1449
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:33,935
Truman needs to know what's next.

1450
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:35,771
What's next? Arms talks.

1451
01:06:35,804 --> 01:06:37,672
-Arms talks. -Obviously.

1452
01:06:38,607 --> 01:06:39,808
What about the Super?

1453
01:06:39,841 --> 01:06:41,576
Does Truman even know about it?

1454
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:43,612
Did we brief him on that?

1455
01:06:43,645 --> 01:06:44,713
Not specifically.

1456
01:06:44,746 --> 01:06:46,049
We still don't know

1457
01:06:46,082 --> 01:06:47,849
if a hydrogen bomb's technically feasible.

1458
01:06:47,883 --> 01:06:49,785
Right, my understanding is that Teller proposed it?

1459
01:06:49,818 --> 01:06:51,653
-ROBERT: Yes. -At Los Alamos?

1460
01:06:51,686 --> 01:06:53,322
Teller's designs have always been wildly impractical.

1461
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:55,690
You'd have to deliver by ox cart.

1462
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:56,992
-Not airplane. -LAWRENCE: Oppie.

1463
01:06:57,025 --> 01:07:00,729
I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence, you want to comment?

1464
01:07:01,963 --> 01:07:03,066
No.

1465
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:07,203
Because if it can put us ahead again,

1466
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:10,273
the President of the United States

1467
01:07:10,306 --> 01:07:12,308
needs to know about it.

1468
01:07:12,341 --> 01:07:13,809
(scoffs)

1469
01:07:13,842 --> 01:07:15,644
And if the Russians know about it already,

1470
01:07:15,677 --> 01:07:18,680
from a spy at Los Alamos,

1471
01:07:18,713 --> 01:07:20,015
then we've gotta get going.

1472
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:23,018
There's no proof there was a spy at Los Alamos.

1473
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:24,120
Robert.

1474
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:27,123
(dramatic music playing)

1475
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:30,725
They put it under the football stadium?

1476
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:32,694
The field's not in use anymore.

1477
01:07:32,727 --> 01:07:34,963
Just as well.

1478
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:38,700
-FERMI: Oppie. -Dr. Fermi.

1479
01:07:38,733 --> 01:07:41,370
(greets in Italian)

1480
01:07:41,404 --> 01:07:42,737
I hear you got a little town.

1481
01:07:42,771 --> 01:07:44,005
Yes. Come and see.

1482
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:45,707
(Szilard scoffs)

1483
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:49,845
Who could think straight in a place like that? Huh?

1484
01:07:49,878 --> 01:07:51,813
Everybody will go crazy.

1485
01:07:51,847 --> 01:07:55,717
Thank you for the vote of confidence, Szilard.

1486
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:59,388
Do we really... do we really need that in the notes?

1487
01:07:59,422 --> 01:08:01,857
When are you going to try it out?

1488
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:02,924
We did.

1489
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:07,330
The first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.

1490
01:08:07,363 --> 01:08:08,997
Didn't Groves tell you?

1491
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:10,665
No.

1492
01:08:10,699 --> 01:08:12,667
(crackling)

1493
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:15,138
(Robert exhales)

1494
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:18,274
One at a time, please, one at a time.

1495
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:19,774
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1496
01:08:20,876 --> 01:08:23,346
I tried Personnel. They asked if I could type.

1497
01:08:23,379 --> 01:08:24,679
Can you?

1498
01:08:24,713 --> 01:08:25,847
Harvard forgot to teach that

1499
01:08:25,881 --> 01:08:27,716
on the graduate chemistry course.

1500
01:08:29,085 --> 01:08:31,987
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig here on the plutonium team.

1501
01:08:33,356 --> 01:08:35,724
(door slams)

1502
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,428
What the hell were you doing in Chicago?

1503
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:40,929
Visiting the Met?

1504
01:08:40,962 --> 01:08:41,963
-Why? Why? -Well, you can't talk to...

1505
01:08:41,997 --> 01:08:44,032
Because we have every right...

1506
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:46,402
You have just the rights that I give you.

1507
01:08:46,435 --> 01:08:47,903
No more, no less.

1508
01:08:47,936 --> 01:08:50,373
We are adults trying to run a project here.

1509
01:08:50,406 --> 01:08:52,108
This is ridiculous.

1510
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:53,909
Tell him.

1511
01:08:53,942 --> 01:08:57,079
Compartmentalization is the protocol we agreed to.

1512
01:08:58,214 --> 01:08:59,448
Enough of this madhouse.

1513
01:08:59,482 --> 01:09:01,850
Nobody can work under these conditions.

1514
01:09:01,883 --> 01:09:06,322
You know what, Generalissimo? I quit.

1515
01:09:06,355 --> 01:09:07,756
Thanks for nothing.

1516
01:09:09,858 --> 01:09:11,360
Better off without him.

1517
01:09:11,394 --> 01:09:12,761
(door slams shut)

1518
01:09:12,794 --> 01:09:13,828
Aren't you more concerned about his discretion out there?

1519
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:16,232
about his discretion out there?

1520
01:09:16,265 --> 01:09:18,668
We'll have him killed.

1521
01:09:19,502 --> 01:09:22,071
I was just kidding. (chuckles)

1522
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:25,040
-No, he hates me, not America. -You know, General,

1523
01:09:25,074 --> 01:09:27,410
not everyone has levers to pull like mine.

1524
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:29,278
I don't think I understand.

1525
01:09:29,312 --> 01:09:31,480
You didn't hire me despite my left-wing past.

1526
01:09:31,514 --> 01:09:33,249
You hired me because of it.

1527
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,219
So you could control me.

1528
01:09:36,252 --> 01:09:38,853
Well, I'm not that subtle.

1529
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:40,922
I'm just a humble soldier.

1530
01:09:40,956 --> 01:09:42,458
You're neither humble nor just a soldier.

1531
01:09:42,491 --> 01:09:43,492
You studied engineering at MIT.

1532
01:09:43,526 --> 01:09:45,361
Guilty as charged.

1533
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:46,895
Well, now we understand each other,

1534
01:09:46,928 --> 01:09:48,364
perhaps you can get me my security clearance

1535
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:51,200
so I can perform this miracle for you.

1536
01:09:56,105 --> 01:09:57,839
LLOYD GARRISON: <i>General Groves, were you aware</i>

1537
01:09:57,872 --> 01:10:00,176
<i>of Dr. Oppenheimer's</i> <i>left-wing associations</i>

1538
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:01,876
<i>when you appointed him?</i>

1539
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,546
I was aware that there were suspicions about him.

1540
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:05,448
I was aware he had a very extreme

1541
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:06,848
liberal background.

1542
01:10:06,881 --> 01:10:08,484
In your opinion, would he ever consciously

1543
01:10:08,517 --> 01:10:09,818
commit a disloyal act?

1544
01:10:09,851 --> 01:10:11,454
I would be amazed if he did.

1545
01:10:11,487 --> 01:10:14,557
So you had complete confidence in his integrity.

1546
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,991
At Los Alamos, yes,

1547
01:10:16,024 --> 01:10:17,360
which is where I really knew him.

1548
01:10:17,393 --> 01:10:19,362
General, did your security officers

1549
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:20,862
on the project advise you

1550
01:10:20,895 --> 01:10:22,365
against the clearance of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1551
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:26,202
They could not and would not clear him until I insisted.

1552
01:10:26,235 --> 01:10:28,870
And it's safe to say that you had a pretty good knowledge

1553
01:10:28,903 --> 01:10:30,139
of Dr. Oppenheimer's security file.

1554
01:10:30,172 --> 01:10:31,840
I did.

1555
01:10:31,873 --> 01:10:33,041
Well, then there's only really one question

1556
01:10:33,075 --> 01:10:34,543
I need answered here today.

1557
01:10:34,577 --> 01:10:36,279
In light of the current AEC guidelines,

1558
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:39,014
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1559
01:10:39,048 --> 01:10:41,117
Do you have the guidelines?

1560
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:50,859
Under current AEC guidelines,

1561
01:10:50,892 --> 01:10:52,927
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1562
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:56,198
-(birds chirping) -(rooster crowing)

1563
01:11:05,141 --> 01:11:08,943
Physics and New Mexico, huh? (chuckles)

1564
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:12,013
My God. What a trek.

1565
01:11:12,048 --> 01:11:13,516
That's why you need a liaison.

1566
01:11:13,549 --> 01:11:15,084
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1567
01:11:16,252 --> 01:11:17,320
You're gonna be okay.

1568
01:11:17,353 --> 01:11:18,521
This way, gentlemen.

1569
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:20,356
(stirring music playing)

1570
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:22,891
(speaking indistinctly)

1571
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:30,333
-Dr. Lawrence. -Leslie.

1572
01:11:30,366 --> 01:11:32,934
I'd like to remind you what we talked about in Berkeley.

1573
01:11:32,967 --> 01:11:35,304
Compartmentalization. I understand completely.

1574
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:39,475
Okay.

1575
01:11:39,508 --> 01:11:40,609
(indistinct chatter)

1576
01:11:40,643 --> 01:11:42,078
Thank you.

1577
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:48,983
(cheering and applauding)

1578
01:11:49,984 --> 01:11:51,220
<i>Greetings from Berkeley.</i>

1579
01:11:51,253 --> 01:11:53,389
I am here to update you on our progress

1580
01:11:53,422 --> 01:11:54,956
and solicit your input.

1581
01:11:54,989 --> 01:11:56,359
To do so, I am going to have to share

1582
01:11:56,392 --> 01:12:00,062
a few things that General Groves told me not to.

1583
01:12:00,096 --> 01:12:01,896
Sorry, General, I said I understood,

1584
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:02,997
not that I agreed.

1585
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:04,567
-(laughter) -'Kay.

1586
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,635
Gentlemen, to business.

1587
01:12:06,669 --> 01:12:09,037
There were rumors of espionage at Los Alamos.

1588
01:12:09,071 --> 01:12:10,539
Unsubstantiated. Unsubstantiated.

1589
01:12:10,573 --> 01:12:12,040
I'm told

1590
01:12:12,074 --> 01:12:13,376
that there were Communists on the project.

1591
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:15,177
We didn't knowingly employ any Communists.

1592
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:16,978
I just want to know, were any of them involved

1593
01:12:17,011 --> 01:12:18,481
in discussions of the Super?

1594
01:12:18,514 --> 01:12:20,683
I seem to remember you demanding your brother come to Los Alamos.

1595
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:22,984
My brother had left the Party by then.

1596
01:12:23,017 --> 01:12:24,253
What about Lomanitz?

1597
01:12:24,286 --> 01:12:26,020
Lomanitz was never employed at Los Alamos.

1598
01:12:26,055 --> 01:12:27,056
He was a liaison.

1599
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:28,257
Our security was tight,

1600
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:29,658
as former Colonel Nichols well knows.

1601
01:12:29,692 --> 01:12:31,260
Our security was as tight as it could be

1602
01:12:31,293 --> 01:12:32,661
given the personalities involved,

1603
01:12:32,695 --> 01:12:34,530
but attempts were made.

1604
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:35,564
What is that supposed to mean?

1605
01:12:35,598 --> 01:12:37,166
We've all read his file here.

1606
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,202
Do we need to talk about Jean Tatlock?

1607
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:42,904
Or the Chevalier incident?

1608
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:48,910
'Scuse me.

1609
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:52,181
(telephone ringing)

1610
01:12:52,214 --> 01:12:54,183
That's Lomanitz, line one.

1611
01:13:00,055 --> 01:13:01,090
Hello, Rossi.

1612
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:04,326
<i>What? O-Okay, just calm down.</i>

1613
01:13:05,294 --> 01:13:08,531
There's been another screw-up. Lomanitz just got drafted.

1614
01:13:08,564 --> 01:13:11,032
-We are at war, Doctor. -Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

1615
01:13:11,066 --> 01:13:13,068
We need this kid. Fix it, will you?

1616
01:13:13,102 --> 01:13:14,303
It wasn't a mistake.

1617
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:15,671
Your friend Lomanitz has been trying

1618
01:13:15,704 --> 01:13:17,972
to unionize the Radiation Lab.

1619
01:13:18,006 --> 01:13:19,308
He promised to quit all that.

1620
01:13:19,341 --> 01:13:21,243
Well, he hasn't.

1621
01:13:21,277 --> 01:13:23,145
Security officer at Berkeley's concerned about

1622
01:13:23,179 --> 01:13:25,481
Communist infiltration through that union,

1623
01:13:25,514 --> 01:13:28,117
-the F.A... -F.A.E.C.T.

1624
01:13:30,519 --> 01:13:34,223
While I'm there next week, I'll drop in to see him.

1625
01:13:36,492 --> 01:13:38,227
Your Q clearance came through.

1626
01:13:41,764 --> 01:13:43,199
It's important you not maintain or renew any questionable associations.

1627
01:13:43,232 --> 01:13:45,501
any questionable associations.

1628
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,741
<i>Doctor, did you think</i> <i>social contacts</i>

1629
01:13:52,775 --> 01:13:55,110
between a person engaged on secret war work

1630
01:13:55,144 --> 01:13:56,512
and Communists was dangerous?

1631
01:13:56,545 --> 01:14:00,216
My awareness of the danger would be greater today.

1632
01:14:00,249 --> 01:14:03,152
I mean, it's fair to say that during the war years,

1633
01:14:03,185 --> 01:14:06,388
<i>you felt that such contacts</i> <i>were potentially dangerous.</i>

1634
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:12,795
(elevator dings)

1635
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:15,798
<i>Were conceivably dangerous, yes.</i>

1636
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:18,100
<i>I mean, really,</i>

1637
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:20,169
<i>known Communists.</i>

1638
01:14:22,304 --> 01:14:24,540
<i>Look... (sighs)</i>

1639
01:14:24,573 --> 01:14:26,108
I've had a lot of secrets

1640
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:29,111
<i>-in my head for a long time.</i> -(knock on door)

1641
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:31,347
<i>Doesn't matter</i> <i>who I associate with.</i>

1642
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,283
I don't talk about those secrets.

1643
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:43,325
You said in your statement

1644
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:49,298
that you had to see Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1645
01:14:50,766 --> 01:14:52,434
You left.

1646
01:14:53,669 --> 01:14:55,104
Not a word.

1647
01:14:55,137 --> 01:14:57,606
What did you think that would do to me?

1648
01:14:58,707 --> 01:14:59,775
I wrote.

1649
01:14:59,808 --> 01:15:02,211
Pages of nothing.

1650
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,815
Where did you go?

1651
01:15:06,849 --> 01:15:09,285
-I can't tell you. -Why not?

1652
01:15:09,318 --> 01:15:12,054
Because you're a Communist.

1653
01:15:13,589 --> 01:15:15,457
Why did you have to see her?

1654
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:18,594
Because she had indicated a great desire

1655
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:20,296
to see me before we left.

1656
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:21,497
At that time, I couldn't,

1657
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:25,334
but I felt that she had to see me.

1658
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:27,870
She was undergoing psychiatric treatment.

1659
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:30,139
She was extremely unhappy.

1660
01:15:30,172 --> 01:15:32,174
Did you find out why she had to see you?

1661
01:15:32,207 --> 01:15:34,343
(grim music playing)

1662
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:39,348
Because she was still in love with me.

1663
01:15:41,216 --> 01:15:44,119
(heavy breathing)

1664
01:15:46,555 --> 01:15:48,624
Spent the night together, didn't you?

1665
01:15:56,599 --> 01:15:57,633
Yes.

1666
01:16:03,305 --> 01:16:07,176
You drop in and out of my life,

1667
01:16:07,209 --> 01:16:09,678
and you don't have to tell me why.

1668
01:16:09,712 --> 01:16:11,180
Now that's power.

1669
01:16:11,213 --> 01:16:13,248
Not that I enjoy.

1670
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:16,352
I'd rather be here for you as you need.

1671
01:16:16,385 --> 01:16:18,854
But you have other priorities now.

1672
01:16:18,887 --> 01:16:21,657
I have a wife and child.

1673
01:16:22,658 --> 01:16:25,461
That's not what either of us is talking about.

1674
01:16:28,897 --> 01:16:30,766
Jean.

1675
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:32,935
You asked me to come.

1676
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:35,337
And I'm glad I did.

1677
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:38,540
But I can't see you again.

1678
01:16:40,943 --> 01:16:42,645
But what if I need you?

1679
01:16:46,215 --> 01:16:49,184
You said you would always answer.

1680
01:16:51,654 --> 01:16:52,788
Not a word?

1681
01:16:54,057 --> 01:16:55,125
<i>Did you think that</i> <i>consistent with good security?</i>

1682
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:57,826
-As a matter of fact, it was. -(rhythmic stomping)

1683
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,229
<i>Not a word.</i>

1684
01:17:00,262 --> 01:17:02,431
When did you see her after that?

1685
01:17:03,265 --> 01:17:05,434
(stomping intensifying)

1686
01:17:08,904 --> 01:17:10,806
(stomping stops)

1687
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:12,508
I never saw her again.

1688
01:17:18,714 --> 01:17:21,350
I can make the last train back to Princeton.

1689
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:24,553
Kitty, I didn't say anything that I hadn't already told you.

1690
01:17:24,586 --> 01:17:26,722
Today you said it to history, didn't you?

1691
01:17:26,755 --> 01:17:28,290
This is a closed hearing.

1692
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:31,593
If they don't release the transcript,

1693
01:17:31,627 --> 01:17:33,629
-I'm sure you will. -ROBERT: I was under oath.

1694
01:17:33,662 --> 01:17:35,431
Well, you were under an oath for me

1695
01:17:35,464 --> 01:17:37,266
when you went to see Jean.

1696
01:17:37,933 --> 01:17:39,368
You know, you...

1697
01:17:40,269 --> 01:17:42,571
...you sit there, day after day,

1698
01:17:42,604 --> 01:17:45,641
letting them pick our lives to pieces.

1699
01:17:48,644 --> 01:17:50,345
Why won't you fight?

1700
01:17:53,482 --> 01:17:56,618
Robert, I'm not putting her up there.

1701
01:18:01,757 --> 01:18:04,626
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an honor. Please, take a seat.

1702
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:08,263
No need, um, I just wanted to check whether I should

1703
01:18:08,297 --> 01:18:10,466
talk to Lomanitz while I'm here, given your concerns.

1704
01:18:10,499 --> 01:18:12,601
Well, I'd say that's really up to you, Professor,

1705
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:14,803
-but I'd be cautious. -Uh-huh. Understood.

1706
01:18:14,837 --> 01:18:17,573
Oh, and, um, (clears throat) as regards to the union,

1707
01:18:17,606 --> 01:18:19,374
I wanted to give you a heads-up on a...

1708
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:20,743
on a man named Eltenton.

1709
01:18:20,776 --> 01:18:22,277
A heads-up?

1710
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:26,248
Yes, just that he might merit watching is all.

1711
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:28,484
Well, I'd love to get more details.

1712
01:18:28,517 --> 01:18:30,853
Well, I... I have an appointment now

1713
01:18:30,886 --> 01:18:32,321
and I leave early tomorrow.

1714
01:18:32,354 --> 01:18:33,889
Well, come back as early as you like.

1715
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:36,258
Since you haven't time now.

1716
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:38,761
You went back the next morning.

1717
01:18:38,794 --> 01:18:40,796
I did, I had to, really.

1718
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:44,333
<i>This time, there was</i> <i>another man.</i>

1719
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,502
He said his name's Pash.

1720
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:49,037
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1721
01:18:49,072 --> 01:18:50,606
Colonel Pash, could you please read

1722
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:54,443
from your memo dated June 29, 1943?

1723
01:18:56,545 --> 01:18:58,647
"Results of surveillance conducted on subject

1724
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,517
"indicate further possible Communist Party connections.

1725
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:03,719
"Subject met with and spent considerable time

1726
01:19:03,752 --> 01:19:05,954
"with one Jean Tatlock, Communist,

1727
01:19:05,988 --> 01:19:07,456
the record of whom is attached."

1728
01:19:07,489 --> 01:19:09,358
The subject being Dr. Oppenheimer?

1729
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:11,860
-PASH: Yes. -ROBB: Whom you had not met?

1730
01:19:11,894 --> 01:19:13,695
Not then, but soon after.

1731
01:19:13,729 --> 01:19:15,098
He's the head of security for the project.

1732
01:19:15,131 --> 01:19:16,365
Shouldn't I know him?

1733
01:19:16,398 --> 01:19:17,733
No, he should know you.

1734
01:19:17,766 --> 01:19:19,668
I would never put you in a room with Pash.

1735
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:20,969
-Why not? -(sighs)

1736
01:19:21,003 --> 01:19:23,072
When Pash first heard about Lomanitz,

1737
01:19:23,106 --> 01:19:26,041
he told the FBI he was gonna kidnap him,

1738
01:19:26,075 --> 01:19:27,543
take him out on a boat

1739
01:19:27,576 --> 01:19:30,579
and interrogate him in the Russian manner.

1740
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:35,551
General Groves has placed in me a certain responsibility,

1741
01:19:35,584 --> 01:19:37,820
and it's like having a child who I can't see.

1742
01:19:37,853 --> 01:19:39,955
-Ah. -By remote control.

1743
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:43,592
-(chuckles quietly) -So to actually meet you is...

1744
01:19:44,693 --> 01:19:46,129
I won't take up too much of your time.

1745
01:19:46,162 --> 01:19:48,430
No, no, not at all. Whatever time you choose.

1746
01:19:48,463 --> 01:19:51,366
Mm. Mr. Johnson told me of a conversation

1747
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,136
you had yesterday in which I'm very interested.

1748
01:19:53,169 --> 01:19:55,437
It's had me worried all day.

1749
01:19:55,470 --> 01:19:57,973
Yes, well, I didn't want to talk to Lomanitz

1750
01:19:58,006 --> 01:19:59,541
without authorization.

1751
01:19:59,575 --> 01:20:00,776
That's not the particular interest that I have.

1752
01:20:00,809 --> 01:20:02,778
It's something a little bit more...

1753
01:20:03,812 --> 01:20:05,581
...well, in my opinion, more serious.

1754
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:08,550
Now, when the FBI pointed out that such information

1755
01:20:08,584 --> 01:20:10,119
wouldn't be admissible in court, Pash made it clear

1756
01:20:10,153 --> 01:20:13,922
he had no intention of leaving any witness left to prosecute.

1757
01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:15,524
Now, the FBI talked him down,

1758
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:17,126
but that's the man you're dancing with.

1759
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,862
I gather you've heard there are other parties

1760
01:20:19,895 --> 01:20:22,598
interested in the work of the Radiation Lab.

1761
01:20:22,631 --> 01:20:26,535
A man attached to the Soviet Consul

1762
01:20:26,568 --> 01:20:29,605
indicated, through intermediate people,

1763
01:20:29,638 --> 01:20:31,174
to people on this project,

1764
01:20:31,207 --> 01:20:34,643
that he was in a position to transmit information.

1765
01:20:34,676 --> 01:20:37,512
Oh, why would anyone on the project want to do that?

1766
01:20:38,947 --> 01:20:41,483
Frankly, I can see that there might be an argument

1767
01:20:41,516 --> 01:20:43,919
for the Commander-in-Chief informing the Russians--

1768
01:20:43,952 --> 01:20:45,821
they're our allies after all--

1769
01:20:45,854 --> 01:20:48,757
but I don't like the idea of it going out the back door.

1770
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:51,526
It might not hurt to be on the lookout for it.

1771
01:20:52,928 --> 01:20:54,097
And you said that to Pash?

1772
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:55,631
I was trying to put it

1773
01:20:55,664 --> 01:20:58,500
in a context of Russia's not Germany.

1774
01:20:58,533 --> 01:21:02,938
Boris Pash is the son of a Russian Orthodox bishop.

1775
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:06,475
Born here, but in 1918, he went back to Russia

1776
01:21:06,508 --> 01:21:07,943
to fight the Bolsheviks.

1777
01:21:07,976 --> 01:21:10,146
This is a man who has killed Communists with his own hands.

1778
01:21:10,179 --> 01:21:13,649
I'm not the judge of who should or should not have information.

1779
01:21:13,682 --> 01:21:15,717
It's my business to stop it from going through illegally.

1780
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:17,953
Would you be a little more specific?

1781
01:21:19,222 --> 01:21:20,789
(smacks lips)

1782
01:21:20,822 --> 01:21:23,692
There's a man whose name was mentioned to me

1783
01:21:23,725 --> 01:21:25,827
a couple of times. Eltenton.

1784
01:21:26,862 --> 01:21:29,965
Uh, I believe he's a chemist who works at Shell.

1785
01:21:29,998 --> 01:21:32,534
He talked to a friend of his

1786
01:21:32,567 --> 01:21:36,471
who's an acquaintance of someone on the project.

1787
01:21:37,706 --> 01:21:40,143
And you thought Pash would be satisfied with that?

1788
01:21:40,176 --> 01:21:42,711
I was attempting to give them Eltenton

1789
01:21:42,744 --> 01:21:44,080
without opening a can of worms.

1790
01:21:44,113 --> 01:21:46,082
I told them a cock-and-bull story.

1791
01:21:46,115 --> 01:21:47,649
Did you lie to General Groves too?

1792
01:21:47,683 --> 01:21:51,220
No. I admitted to him that I'd lied to Pash.

1793
01:21:51,254 --> 01:21:52,688
Do you recall this conversation

1794
01:21:52,721 --> 01:21:55,124
-about the Chevalier incident? -(scoffs)

1795
01:21:55,158 --> 01:21:57,559
I've seen so many versions of it. Um...

1796
01:21:57,592 --> 01:21:58,760
Wasn't confused before,

1797
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:00,229
but I'm certainly getting there now.

1798
01:22:00,263 --> 01:22:01,563
And what was your conclusion?

1799
01:22:01,596 --> 01:22:03,966
That he was under the influence of

1800
01:22:03,999 --> 01:22:06,868
the typical American schoolboy attitude

1801
01:22:06,902 --> 01:22:10,505
that there's something wicked about telling on a friend.

1802
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:12,574
Well, now.

1803
01:22:12,607 --> 01:22:15,043
Might we know through whom the contact was made?

1804
01:22:15,078 --> 01:22:17,280
That would in... involve people

1805
01:22:17,313 --> 01:22:19,282
who are not to be involved in this.

1806
01:22:19,315 --> 01:22:22,085
Is that someone a member of the project?

1807
01:22:22,118 --> 01:22:26,655
A member of the faculty, yes, but not in the project, no.

1808
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,789
Ah.

1809
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:29,591
So Eltenton made his approach

1810
01:22:29,624 --> 01:22:32,861
through a member of the faculty here at Berkeley?

1811
01:22:34,596 --> 01:22:37,066
As far as I know. As far as I know, yes.

1812
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,735
But there-there may have been

1813
01:22:39,768 --> 01:22:42,504
more than one person involved.

1814
01:22:45,907 --> 01:22:49,112
Gentlemen, if I... if I seem uncooperative,

1815
01:22:49,145 --> 01:22:52,081
I think you can understand that's because of my insistence

1816
01:22:52,115 --> 01:22:54,716
in not getting innocent people into trouble.

1817
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,551
<i>You're trying</i> <i>to protect your friend.</i>

1818
01:22:56,585 --> 01:22:57,819
Who's protecting you?

1819
01:22:57,853 --> 01:22:59,255
Well, you could.

1820
01:22:59,288 --> 01:23:00,622
If you gave me the name.

1821
01:23:00,655 --> 01:23:02,591
If you order me to, I'll do it.

1822
01:23:02,624 --> 01:23:03,658
That's a mistake, Robert.

1823
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:05,527
You need to volunteer this name.

1824
01:23:06,362 --> 01:23:08,030
<i>And did he give you the name?</i>

1825
01:23:08,064 --> 01:23:09,198
<i>He did.</i>

1826
01:23:09,232 --> 01:23:10,699
-ROBB: But not then, did he? -No.

1827
01:23:10,732 --> 01:23:12,201
No. In fact, it was some months later, wasn't it?

1828
01:23:12,235 --> 01:23:14,137
It was.

1829
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:15,271
You see me as persistent.

1830
01:23:15,304 --> 01:23:17,039
Well, you are...

1831
01:23:17,073 --> 01:23:18,907
you are persistent, but that is your job.

1832
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:22,644
And-and my job is to protect the people that work for me.

1833
01:23:22,677 --> 01:23:24,679
Instead of us going on certain steps,

1834
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:26,815
which may come to your attention...

1835
01:23:28,184 --> 01:23:29,951
...and be disturbing to you,

1836
01:23:29,985 --> 01:23:33,089
I would like to discuss those with you first.

1837
01:23:33,122 --> 01:23:34,623
I'm not formulating a plan.

1838
01:23:34,656 --> 01:23:36,992
I'll just have to digest the whole thing.

1839
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:43,332
<i>In the months</i> <i>in between your interview</i>

1840
01:23:43,366 --> 01:23:47,002
with Dr. Oppenheimer and his eventual naming of Chevalier,

1841
01:23:47,035 --> 01:23:48,337
did you expend resources

1842
01:23:48,371 --> 01:23:49,838
trying to find the name of the intermediary?

1843
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:52,341
Considerable resources, yes.

1844
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:54,609
Without the name, our job was extremely difficult.

1845
01:23:54,643 --> 01:23:56,079
And when did you receive the name?

1846
01:23:56,112 --> 01:23:57,346
I was gone by the time

1847
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,815
-Oppenheimer finally offered it up. -Gone?

1848
01:23:59,848 --> 01:24:02,017
They felt my time would be better spent in Europe

1849
01:24:02,051 --> 01:24:04,786
determining the status of the Nazi bomb project.

1850
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:05,987
Who did?

1851
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:08,824
General Groves.

1852
01:24:08,857 --> 01:24:10,625
He transferred me to London.

1853
01:24:17,066 --> 01:24:19,168
<i>It's a little early</i> <i>for a Christmas party.</i>

1854
01:24:19,202 --> 01:24:21,204
Something's up.

1855
01:24:21,237 --> 01:24:23,272
Tolman's been away.

1856
01:24:23,306 --> 01:24:25,006
Where?

1857
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,608
Ruth won't tell.

1858
01:24:29,145 --> 01:24:31,114
(lively chatter and laughter)

1859
01:24:31,147 --> 01:24:32,148
Hey!

1860
01:24:32,181 --> 01:24:33,882
(playing upbeat music)

1861
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:37,853
Come on, Ruthie.

1862
01:24:37,886 --> 01:24:39,955
Can't tell me, who can you tell?

1863
01:24:39,988 --> 01:24:42,724
Compartmentalization, Oppie.

1864
01:24:42,757 --> 01:24:44,127
What makes you think I know where he is anyway?

1865
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,861
'Cause you do a pretty good job

1866
01:24:45,894 --> 01:24:48,663
of knowing where Mr. Tolman is when it counts.

1867
01:24:48,697 --> 01:24:50,233
Like now?

1868
01:24:50,266 --> 01:24:53,702
Attention!

1869
01:24:53,735 --> 01:24:55,637
(chatter and music subside)

1870
01:24:56,905 --> 01:24:58,840
Early Christmas present for you all.

1871
01:25:00,243 --> 01:25:03,044
(applause)

1872
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:05,647
(crowd cheering)

1873
01:25:06,915 --> 01:25:09,285
<i>The British pilots</i> <i>put me in the bomb bay.</i>

1874
01:25:09,318 --> 01:25:11,320
Showed me the-the oxygen, you know,

1875
01:25:11,354 --> 01:25:13,089
-but I messed it up. -(crowd laughs)

1876
01:25:13,122 --> 01:25:15,724
Uh, when they opened me up in Scotland, I was unconscious.

1877
01:25:15,757 --> 01:25:17,959
But I pretended I'd been napping.

1878
01:25:17,993 --> 01:25:18,894
(crowd laughing)

1879
01:25:18,927 --> 01:25:20,363
Please enjoy your party.

1880
01:25:20,396 --> 01:25:21,696
(light applause)

1881
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:23,031
(whispering): Is it big enough?

1882
01:25:23,065 --> 01:25:24,333
To end the war?

1883
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:27,270
To end all war.

1884
01:25:28,803 --> 01:25:30,072
(intriguing music playing)

1885
01:25:30,106 --> 01:25:34,177
Uh, Heisenberg sought me out in Copenhagen.

1886
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:35,944
It was chilling,

1887
01:25:35,977 --> 01:25:38,013
my old student working for the Nazis.

1888
01:25:38,047 --> 01:25:41,950
He told me some things to draw me out.

1889
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:46,189
Sustained fission reactions in uranium.

1890
01:25:46,222 --> 01:25:48,424
That sounds more like a reactor than a bomb.

1891
01:25:48,457 --> 01:25:49,891
Did he mention gaseous diffusion?

1892
01:25:49,925 --> 01:25:52,195
He seemed more focused on heavy water.

1893
01:25:52,228 --> 01:25:53,929
As a moderator?

1894
01:25:53,962 --> 01:25:55,331
Yes, instead of graphite.

1895
01:25:55,364 --> 01:25:57,699
-(Teller snorts) -(laughter)

1896
01:25:58,367 --> 01:25:59,734
What?

1897
01:25:59,768 --> 01:26:01,937
He took a wrong turn.

1898
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:04,440
We're ahead. And with you here to help us, Niels.

1899
01:26:04,473 --> 01:26:06,741
Sorry, could you...

1900
01:26:06,775 --> 01:26:09,711
could you give us a moment, gentlemen?

1901
01:26:15,884 --> 01:26:18,421
I am not here to help, Robert.

1902
01:26:18,454 --> 01:26:20,356
I knew you could do this without me.

1903
01:26:20,389 --> 01:26:21,490
Then why did you come?

1904
01:26:21,524 --> 01:26:22,958
To talk about after.

1905
01:26:22,991 --> 01:26:24,960
The power you're about to reveal

1906
01:26:24,993 --> 01:26:27,196
will forever outlive the Nazis.

1907
01:26:28,264 --> 01:26:29,864
And the world is not prepared.

1908
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:31,300
"You could lift the stone

1909
01:26:31,334 --> 01:26:33,969
without being ready for the snake that's revealed."

1910
01:26:34,002 --> 01:26:35,371
We have to make the politicians understand,

1911
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:37,506
this isn't a new weapon.

1912
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,007
It's a new world.

1913
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:42,411
I'll be out there doing what I can, but you...

1914
01:26:42,445 --> 01:26:45,013
you're an American Prometheus.

1915
01:26:45,047 --> 01:26:47,283
The man who gave them the power

1916
01:26:47,316 --> 01:26:49,352
to destroy themselves,

1917
01:26:49,385 --> 01:26:51,019
and they'll respect that.

1918
01:26:51,053 --> 01:26:53,222
And your work really begins.

1919
01:26:57,159 --> 01:27:00,296
I'm sorry, Oppie, but there's a call.

1920
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:04,166
From San Francisco.

1921
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,269
(somber music playing)

1922
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:12,141
Robert!

1923
01:27:15,378 --> 01:27:16,911
Robert?

1924
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,149
Robert. Robert.

1925
01:27:20,182 --> 01:27:22,385
-God, what's the matter? -(grunts softly)

1926
01:27:22,418 --> 01:27:24,186
-What happened? -(sighs)

1927
01:27:25,054 --> 01:27:26,988
Her father called.

1928
01:27:27,022 --> 01:27:29,158
They found her yesterday in the bath.

1929
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:31,294
Who?

1930
01:27:32,295 --> 01:27:34,297
She'd taken pills.

1931
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:36,232
<i>Left a note, not signed.</i>

1932
01:27:37,233 --> 01:27:38,200
She took barbiturates,

1933
01:27:38,234 --> 01:27:40,169
but there was chloral hydrate in her blood.

1934
01:27:40,202 --> 01:27:41,570
(muffled screaming)

1935
01:27:41,604 --> 01:27:43,506
(screaming stops)

1936
01:27:43,539 --> 01:27:44,873
There was a note.

1937
01:27:44,906 --> 01:27:47,209
(whispering): Jean Tatlock?

1938
01:27:52,981 --> 01:27:54,983
We were together.

1939
01:27:55,016 --> 01:27:57,819
She said she needed me. I...

1940
01:27:59,921 --> 01:28:02,857
I told her I... I wouldn't... (shudders)

1941
01:28:02,891 --> 01:28:04,527
I told her I couldn't...

1942
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,228
No, it was... it was me.

1943
01:28:08,029 --> 01:28:09,198
(Kitty breathing heavily)

1944
01:28:09,231 --> 01:28:11,334
You don't get to commit the sin

1945
01:28:11,367 --> 01:28:13,169
and then have us all feel sorry for you

1946
01:28:13,202 --> 01:28:16,072
that it had consequences. (breath shuddering)

1947
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:20,343
-You pull yourself together. -(sniffling)

1948
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:26,148
You know, people here depend on you.

1949
01:28:28,651 --> 01:28:30,119
Donald, would you like

1950
01:28:30,152 --> 01:28:31,220
to contribute here? Please, help me out.

1951
01:28:31,253 --> 01:28:32,455
You're on your own, pal.

1952
01:28:32,488 --> 01:28:33,589
Bob, I'm not quitting my job

1953
01:28:33,622 --> 01:28:34,956
because plutonium is radioactive.

1954
01:28:34,989 --> 01:28:36,525
We just don't know what it might do

1955
01:28:36,559 --> 01:28:38,294
to the female reproductive system...

1956
01:28:38,327 --> 01:28:40,229
Your reproductive system is more exposed than mine, presumably.

1957
01:28:40,262 --> 01:28:43,132
Can we please? The implosion device is nowhere.

1958
01:28:43,165 --> 01:28:44,567
Hey, you can't rush everything.

1959
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,135
-Oppie, please. -Well, there's rushing

1960
01:28:46,168 --> 01:28:47,969
and there's getting on with it, so pick one.

1961
01:28:48,002 --> 01:28:50,004
Wait. Neddermeyer's doing his job.

1962
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:50,972
Teller's not helping.

1963
01:28:51,005 --> 01:28:52,541
You're not helping.

1964
01:28:52,575 --> 01:28:53,975
I've been asking for calculations

1965
01:28:54,008 --> 01:28:55,144
on the implosion lenses for weeks.

1966
01:28:55,177 --> 01:28:56,645
The British can do it. Fuchs.

1967
01:28:56,679 --> 01:28:57,979
Absolutely.

1968
01:28:58,012 --> 01:28:59,382
It's your job, Teller.

1969
01:28:59,415 --> 01:29:01,217
I'm engaged in research.

1970
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:03,918
On a hydrogen bomb we're not even building.

1971
01:29:03,952 --> 01:29:05,388
(others laughing)

1972
01:29:12,026 --> 01:29:13,396
I won't work for that man.

1973
01:29:13,429 --> 01:29:15,131
(others exclaim)

1974
01:29:15,164 --> 01:29:17,266
Let him go. He's a prima donna.

1975
01:29:17,299 --> 01:29:19,535
I agree. He should leave Los Alamos.

1976
01:29:19,568 --> 01:29:21,070
Okay.

1977
01:29:21,103 --> 01:29:22,971
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer.

1978
01:29:23,004 --> 01:29:24,407
Seth, I'm putting you on plutonium.

1979
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,543
Lilli, you go work for Kisty. Because he needs you.

1980
01:29:27,576 --> 01:29:30,146
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

1981
01:29:30,179 --> 01:29:32,548
I'm putting you exclusively on the implosion device.

1982
01:29:32,581 --> 01:29:36,352
And no one is leaving Los Alamos.

1983
01:29:36,385 --> 01:29:39,121
(rousing music playing)

1984
01:29:50,599 --> 01:29:52,568
-They won't let me leave. -ROBERT: No.

1985
01:29:52,601 --> 01:29:54,203
I won't let you leave.

1986
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:58,174
Forget Hans. Forget fission.

1987
01:29:58,207 --> 01:30:01,343
Stay here, research what you want.

1988
01:30:01,377 --> 01:30:03,978
Fusion, the hydrogen bomb, whatever.

1989
01:30:04,012 --> 01:30:05,181
We'll meet to discuss.

1990
01:30:05,214 --> 01:30:06,682
You don't have time to meet.

1991
01:30:06,715 --> 01:30:08,284
You're a politician now, Robert.

1992
01:30:08,317 --> 01:30:10,952
You've left physics behind many, many years ago.

1993
01:30:11,787 --> 01:30:13,589
Once a week.

1994
01:30:13,622 --> 01:30:15,491
One hour. You and me.

1995
01:30:20,663 --> 01:30:23,232
Now raise this fucking barrier.

1996
01:30:27,169 --> 01:30:29,605
<i>So the Super</i> <i>was under development</i>

1997
01:30:29,638 --> 01:30:31,607
<i>on your watch at Los Alamos?</i>

1998
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,142
Yes.

1999
01:30:33,175 --> 01:30:35,043
And yet, after the war,

2000
01:30:35,077 --> 01:30:36,679
you tried to deny it was viable.

2001
01:30:36,712 --> 01:30:38,214
No, no, no. I...

2002
01:30:38,247 --> 01:30:40,082
I pointed out technical difficulties with it.

2003
01:30:40,115 --> 01:30:41,750
You... Didn't you try to kill it at the AEC meeting

2004
01:30:41,784 --> 01:30:43,352
-after the Russian bomb test? -No.

2005
01:30:43,385 --> 01:30:45,488
But that was the recommendation of the AEC,

2006
01:30:45,521 --> 01:30:47,790
-was it not? -After hours of discussion

2007
01:30:47,823 --> 01:30:50,092
<i>about the best response.</i>

2008
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:55,231
An H-bomb is 1,000 times the power of an A-bomb.

2009
01:30:56,398 --> 01:31:00,169
Its only intended target would be the largest cities.

2010
01:31:00,202 --> 01:31:02,304
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

2011
01:31:02,338 --> 01:31:04,640
Izzy, draw some circles on this side of the map

2012
01:31:04,673 --> 01:31:06,308
where they would target us.

2013
01:31:06,342 --> 01:31:08,377
-Starting with New York. D.C. -RABI: That's fair.

2014
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:11,180
It's a weapon of attack with no defensive value.

2015
01:31:11,213 --> 01:31:12,748
-Deterrence. -BUSH: "Deterrence"?

2016
01:31:12,781 --> 01:31:14,383
Do we really need more deterrence

2017
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:16,819
than our current arsenal of atomic bombs?

2018
01:31:16,852 --> 01:31:19,555
Y-You drown in ten feet of water or-or 10,000,

2019
01:31:19,588 --> 01:31:21,257
-what's the difference? -(rhythmic stomping)

2020
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:23,259
We can already drown Russia. They know it.

2021
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:25,561
-And now they can drown us. -So we're just escalating...

2022
01:31:25,594 --> 01:31:27,396
(stomping intensifying)

2023
01:31:27,429 --> 01:31:29,632
(discussion continues indistinctly)

2024
01:31:33,469 --> 01:31:35,070
(stomping stops)

2025
01:31:36,472 --> 01:31:39,308
As I said, Teller's designs are still as

2026
01:31:39,341 --> 01:31:41,277
impractical as they were during the war.

2027
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:44,280
A hydrogen bomb can be made to work, Oppie, you know that.

2028
01:31:44,313 --> 01:31:45,447
I don't believe we should commit

2029
01:31:45,481 --> 01:31:47,383
all our resources to that chance.

2030
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:50,286
Then how would you have Truman reassure the American people?

2031
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:52,521
Simply by limiting the spread of atomic weapons

2032
01:31:52,555 --> 01:31:55,858
through international control on nuclear energy.

2033
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:57,459
By which you mean world government?

2034
01:31:57,493 --> 01:32:00,429
The United Nations as Roosevelt intended.

2035
01:32:00,462 --> 01:32:03,365
Well, I... I asked what Truman should do, right?

2036
01:32:03,399 --> 01:32:06,302
The world's changed, it's not fascism but Communism

2037
01:32:06,335 --> 01:32:07,803
that now threatens our survival.

2038
01:32:07,836 --> 01:32:11,473
Lewis, do you understand, if we build a hydrogen bomb,

2039
01:32:11,507 --> 01:32:14,376
the Russians will have no choice but to build their own?

2040
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:16,178
Could they be working on one already?

2041
01:32:16,211 --> 01:32:18,714
Based on information gathered from a spy at Los Alamos.

2042
01:32:18,747 --> 01:32:20,215
No spy at Los Alamos.

2043
01:32:20,249 --> 01:32:21,317
-Gentlemen. -There wasn't?

2044
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:22,585
Let's not get sidetracked.

2045
01:32:22,618 --> 01:32:24,320
I say we use this moment

2046
01:32:24,353 --> 01:32:25,754
to gain concessions from the Russians

2047
01:32:25,788 --> 01:32:28,857
by committing that we will not build a hydrogen bomb.

2048
01:32:28,891 --> 01:32:30,526
Thereby revealing its existence.

2049
01:32:30,559 --> 01:32:32,561
Which you seem convinced they already know.

2050
01:32:32,595 --> 01:32:34,196
(clears throat) All right.

2051
01:32:34,229 --> 01:32:36,332
At this point, I'd like the committee members

2052
01:32:36,365 --> 01:32:40,302
to meet in privacy to finalize our recommendations.

2053
01:32:41,437 --> 01:32:43,439
I'm just not sure you want to go down this road.

2054
01:32:43,472 --> 01:32:45,741
Lewis, with respect, we are the advisory committee,

2055
01:32:45,774 --> 01:32:47,543
we will give them our advice.

2056
01:32:47,576 --> 01:32:48,677
Good night.

2057
01:32:52,881 --> 01:32:57,152
Dr. Oppenheimer? Hi. William Borden.

2058
01:32:57,186 --> 01:32:58,520
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy?

2059
01:32:58,554 --> 01:32:59,755
Oh, yes, yes.

2060
01:32:59,788 --> 01:33:01,423
During the war, I was a pilot.

2061
01:33:02,558 --> 01:33:05,294
One night, flying back from a raid,

2062
01:33:05,327 --> 01:33:08,230
I saw an amazing sight like a meteor.

2063
01:33:08,263 --> 01:33:09,398
(engine rumbling)

2064
01:33:09,431 --> 01:33:12,201
<i>A V-2 rocket headed to England.</i>

2065
01:33:12,234 --> 01:33:14,236
I can't help but imagine what it will be

2066
01:33:14,269 --> 01:33:18,173
for such an enemy rocket to carry an atomic warhead.

2067
01:33:18,207 --> 01:33:20,275
(rhythmic stomping)

2068
01:33:20,909 --> 01:33:21,844
(rocket engine rumbling)

2069
01:33:21,877 --> 01:33:24,446
(stomping intensifying)

2070
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,347
(stomping stops)

2071
01:33:26,949 --> 01:33:28,283
Well, let's make sure we're not the ones

2072
01:33:28,317 --> 01:33:29,618
to make that possible.

2073
01:33:36,325 --> 01:33:39,228
Oppie, I don't think you want to go up against Strauss.

2074
01:33:39,261 --> 01:33:41,330
If we both speak, they listen to me.

2075
01:33:41,363 --> 01:33:43,432
When you speak, they hear a prophet.

2076
01:33:43,465 --> 01:33:45,434
When Strauss speaks, they hear themselves.

2077
01:33:45,467 --> 01:33:47,269
They'll listen to a prophet.

2078
01:33:47,302 --> 01:33:50,572
A prophet can't be wrong. Not once.

2079
01:33:50,606 --> 01:33:52,374
SENATOR McGEE: <i>Didn't you accuse Oppenheimer</i>

2080
01:33:52,408 --> 01:33:54,309
<i>of sabotaging the development</i> <i>of the Super?</i>

2081
01:33:54,343 --> 01:33:55,944
I was never one of those

2082
01:33:55,978 --> 01:33:59,248
to bandy around terms like "sabotage."

2083
01:33:59,281 --> 01:34:01,250
SENATOR McGEE: <i>But Mr. Borden was?</i>

2084
01:34:01,283 --> 01:34:02,551
As I understand it, possibly.

2085
01:34:02,584 --> 01:34:04,687
How was Mr. Borden able to put together

2086
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:05,988
such a detailed indictment?

2087
01:34:06,021 --> 01:34:07,556
<i>He was no longer</i> <i>a government employee,</i>

2088
01:34:07,589 --> 01:34:10,225
yet he appears to have had unlimited access

2089
01:34:10,259 --> 01:34:11,760
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

2090
01:34:11,794 --> 01:34:14,697
<i>Might Mr. Nichols have</i> <i>given him access to the file?</i>

2091
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:16,632
Or someone else, at the AEC?

2092
01:34:16,665 --> 01:34:19,501
That's a very serious accusation, Senator.

2093
01:34:19,535 --> 01:34:22,004
Is it your intention to suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer

2094
01:34:22,037 --> 01:34:23,972
is disloyal to the United States?

2095
01:34:24,006 --> 01:34:26,542
I've always assumed, and still assume,

2096
01:34:26,575 --> 01:34:29,278
that he's loyal to the United States.

2097
01:34:29,311 --> 01:34:30,746
I believe this. And I shall believe it

2098
01:34:30,779 --> 01:34:33,582
until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.

2099
01:34:33,615 --> 01:34:35,384
<i>Do you or do you not believe</i>

2100
01:34:35,417 --> 01:34:37,786
<i>that Dr. Oppenheimer</i> <i>is a security risk?</i>

2101
01:34:38,887 --> 01:34:41,356
(suspenseful music plays)

2102
01:34:45,994 --> 01:34:47,629
PHILIP MORRISON: And if I may,

2103
01:34:47,663 --> 01:34:50,466
when Hitler blew his brains out in that bunker,

2104
01:34:50,499 --> 01:34:52,034
it's my humble opinion that there is no need

2105
01:34:52,068 --> 01:34:53,535
for that bomb to be seen anywhere

2106
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:55,337
-except for that test site. -(applause)

2107
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:57,372
But we at least have to take a moment

2108
01:34:57,406 --> 01:34:59,408
to think about whether the means

2109
01:34:59,441 --> 01:35:01,710
justify the ends any longer, because...

2110
01:35:04,046 --> 01:35:06,615
Germany is about to surrender.

2111
01:35:06,648 --> 01:35:08,484
(applause)

2112
01:35:08,517 --> 01:35:11,854
It's no longer the enemy who are the greatest threat

2113
01:35:11,887 --> 01:35:13,689
to mankind, it's our work.

2114
01:35:13,722 --> 01:35:15,390
(people murmur)

2115
01:35:16,092 --> 01:35:18,827
Hitler's dead, it's true.

2116
01:35:20,529 --> 01:35:22,065
But the Japanese fight on.

2117
01:35:22,098 --> 01:35:23,766
Their defeat seems assured.

2118
01:35:23,799 --> 01:35:26,802
Not if you're a G.I. preparing to invade.

2119
01:35:28,104 --> 01:35:29,404
We can end this war.

2120
01:35:29,438 --> 01:35:30,839
But how do we justify

2121
01:35:30,873 --> 01:35:32,441
using this weapon on human beings?

2122
01:35:32,474 --> 01:35:34,409
-(murmurs of assent) -(scattered applause)

2123
01:35:35,477 --> 01:35:38,881
We're theorists, yes?

2124
01:35:38,914 --> 01:35:40,516
Yes. Yep.

2125
01:35:40,549 --> 01:35:44,586
We imagine a future and our imaginings horrify us.

2126
01:35:45,654 --> 01:35:47,790
But they won't fear it until they understand it,

2127
01:35:47,823 --> 01:35:50,726
and they won't understand it until they've used it.

2128
01:35:50,759 --> 01:35:51,927
When the world learns

2129
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,463
the terrible secret of Los Alamos,

2130
01:35:54,496 --> 01:35:57,933
our work here will ensure a peace mankind has never seen.

2131
01:35:57,966 --> 01:36:01,336
A peace based on the kind of international cooperation

2132
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:03,405
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

2133
01:36:03,438 --> 01:36:05,541
(scattered applause)

2134
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:09,745
<i>Progress?</i>

2135
01:36:09,778 --> 01:36:12,548
Two years and a billion dollars' worth?

2136
01:36:12,581 --> 01:36:14,349
Well, hard to put a price on it.

2137
01:36:14,383 --> 01:36:15,951
Not really, just add up the bills.

2138
01:36:15,984 --> 01:36:17,686
"Rural free deliveries."

2139
01:36:17,719 --> 01:36:20,489
Eighty babies delivered the first year.

2140
01:36:20,522 --> 01:36:22,858
This year, we've had ten a month.

2141
01:36:22,891 --> 01:36:25,627
Birth control is a little out of my jurisdiction, General.

2142
01:36:26,495 --> 01:36:28,831
-GROVES: Clearly. -KITTY: General.

2143
01:36:28,864 --> 01:36:30,766
(thrilling music playing)

2144
01:36:33,802 --> 01:36:35,138
Head down, everyone.

2145
01:36:35,171 --> 01:36:37,339
Fuchs, head down.

2146
01:36:39,842 --> 01:36:41,009
Hmm? (sniffs)

2147
01:36:41,043 --> 01:36:42,044
(spool winds)

2148
01:36:42,078 --> 01:36:43,846
(explosion)

2149
01:36:43,879 --> 01:36:45,614
That's the one. (grunts)

2150
01:36:45,647 --> 01:36:48,550
Two viable bombs. I need a date.

2151
01:36:50,853 --> 01:36:52,688
September.

2152
01:36:52,721 --> 01:36:53,722
July.

2153
01:36:53,755 --> 01:36:55,691
That's the sweet spot, gentlemen.

2154
01:36:55,724 --> 01:36:57,893
August.

2155
01:36:57,926 --> 01:36:59,661
July.

2156
01:36:59,695 --> 01:37:01,496
Test in July.

2157
01:37:01,530 --> 01:37:03,166
But I need my brother.

2158
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:05,701
(thrilling music continues)

2159
01:37:07,536 --> 01:37:09,471
Frank knows the desert, he's left politics behind,

2160
01:37:09,504 --> 01:37:11,940
he's been working with Lawrence for two years now.

2161
01:37:18,914 --> 01:37:20,749
What do we call the test?

2162
01:37:21,850 --> 01:37:25,621
"Batter my heart, three-person'd god."

2163
01:37:25,654 --> 01:37:26,755
What?

2164
01:37:28,124 --> 01:37:29,524
Trinity.

2165
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,567
You insisted

2166
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:39,902
on bringing on your brother Frank,

2167
01:37:39,935 --> 01:37:41,536
-a known Communist. -A former Communist.

2168
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:44,006
You brought a known former Communist

2169
01:37:44,039 --> 01:37:47,910
onto America's most secret and important defense project.

2170
01:37:47,943 --> 01:37:51,046
I knew my brother could be trusted. Absolutely.

2171
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:53,049
And you felt your judgment was sound

2172
01:37:53,082 --> 01:37:54,917
on who on the team could be trusted?

2173
01:37:55,918 --> 01:37:57,053
Fuchs, head down.

2174
01:37:57,086 --> 01:37:58,820
Okay, everybody ready?

2175
01:38:00,189 --> 01:38:02,125
Hmm? (sniffs)

2176
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:03,926
-(spool winds) -Oh.

2177
01:38:03,959 --> 01:38:05,560
(explosion)

2178
01:38:07,063 --> 01:38:08,197
Oh.

2179
01:38:08,231 --> 01:38:09,965
Well, I hope you learned something.

2180
01:38:09,998 --> 01:38:11,900
Yeah, we learned we're gonna need to be a lot further away.

2181
01:38:11,934 --> 01:38:13,502
Well, figure it out. Fast.

2182
01:38:13,535 --> 01:38:15,204
We leave for Washington in the morning.

2183
01:38:15,238 --> 01:38:17,439
We're gonna give them a date.

2184
01:38:22,978 --> 01:38:24,680
(telephones ringing)

2185
01:38:31,586 --> 01:38:33,256
You're a long way from Chicago, Leo.

2186
01:38:33,289 --> 01:38:34,790
If we don't act now,

2187
01:38:34,823 --> 01:38:36,525
they're going to use this thing against Japan.

2188
01:38:36,558 --> 01:38:38,527
We booked a meeting with Truman,

2189
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,828
but somebody killed it.

2190
01:38:39,861 --> 01:38:41,730
You're meeting the Secretary of War.

2191
01:38:41,763 --> 01:38:43,932
Just because we're building it,

2192
01:38:43,966 --> 01:38:45,968
doesn't mean we get to decide how it's used.

2193
01:38:46,001 --> 01:38:48,770
History will judge us, Robert.

2194
01:38:48,804 --> 01:38:52,108
In Chicago, we put together a petition.

2195
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:54,077
I'm not... I'm not getting into that.

2196
01:38:54,110 --> 01:38:55,844
(clattering)

2197
01:38:55,877 --> 01:38:57,579
(sighs)

2198
01:38:59,148 --> 01:39:01,084
Just tell me your concerns, and I'll relay them.

2199
01:39:01,117 --> 01:39:02,218
My concerns?

2200
01:39:02,251 --> 01:39:04,220
Germany's defeated.

2201
01:39:04,253 --> 01:39:06,021
Japan's not going to hold out alone.

2202
01:39:06,055 --> 01:39:07,956
How could you know that? You got us into this.

2203
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:09,758
You and Einstein with your letter to Roosevelt

2204
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:12,594
-saying we could build a bomb. -(scoffs) Against Germany.

2205
01:39:12,627 --> 01:39:15,564
That's not how weapons manufacture works, Szilard.

2206
01:39:15,597 --> 01:39:16,732
Oppie, you have to help.

2207
01:39:16,765 --> 01:39:18,067
Fermi's in the meeting.

2208
01:39:18,101 --> 01:39:19,668
-Lawrence is in the meeting. -They're not you.

2209
01:39:19,701 --> 01:39:21,870
You're the great salesman of science.

2210
01:39:21,903 --> 01:39:24,506
You can convince anyone of anything.

2211
01:39:25,208 --> 01:39:26,608
Even yourself.

2212
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:28,610
'Scuse me.

2213
01:39:29,644 --> 01:39:32,914
The firestorm in Tokyo killed
100,000 people.

2214
01:39:32,948 --> 01:39:34,750
Mostly civilians.

2215
01:39:34,783 --> 01:39:37,320
I worry about an America where we do these things

2216
01:39:37,353 --> 01:39:39,088
and no one protests.

2217
01:39:39,122 --> 01:39:42,158
Pearl Harbor and three years of brutal conflict in the Pacific

2218
01:39:42,191 --> 01:39:44,726
bought us a lot of latitude with the American public.

2219
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,795
Enough to unleash the atomic bomb?

2220
01:39:46,828 --> 01:39:48,697
Uh, the A-bomb might not cause

2221
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:50,632
as much damage as the Tokyo bombings.

2222
01:39:50,665 --> 01:39:52,034
What are we estimating?

2223
01:39:52,068 --> 01:39:54,903
In a medium-size city, uh,

2224
01:39:54,936 --> 01:39:56,339
20 or 30,000 dead.

2225
01:39:56,372 --> 01:39:58,174
Yes, but, uh,

2226
01:39:58,207 --> 01:40:01,244
don't underestimate the psychological impact of a...

2227
01:40:01,277 --> 01:40:02,677
of an atomic explosion.

2228
01:40:02,711 --> 01:40:06,948
A pillar of fire
10,000 feet tall.

2229
01:40:06,982 --> 01:40:10,319
Deadly neutron effects for a mile, in all directions,

2230
01:40:10,353 --> 01:40:13,256
from one single device.

2231
01:40:13,289 --> 01:40:15,624
Dropped from a barely noticed B-29,

2232
01:40:15,657 --> 01:40:17,926
the atomic bomb will be

2233
01:40:17,959 --> 01:40:20,796
a terrible revelation of divine power.

2234
01:40:20,829 --> 01:40:24,100
If that's true, it would be definitive.

2235
01:40:24,133 --> 01:40:26,202
World War II would be over.

2236
01:40:26,235 --> 01:40:27,936
Our boys would come home.

2237
01:40:27,969 --> 01:40:29,105
Military targets?

2238
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:32,908
Uh, there aren't any big enough.

2239
01:40:32,941 --> 01:40:38,713
Perhaps a vital war plant with workers housed nearby.

2240
01:40:38,747 --> 01:40:41,084
And we could issue a warning to reduce civilian casualties.

2241
01:40:41,117 --> 01:40:43,286
They'd send everything they have up against us,

2242
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:44,920
and I'd be up in that plane.

2243
01:40:44,953 --> 01:40:48,157
But if we announce it and it fails to go off,

2244
01:40:48,191 --> 01:40:50,892
we'd scupper any chance of a Japanese surrender.

2245
01:40:50,926 --> 01:40:54,029
Is there no way to demonstrate a bomb to Japan

2246
01:40:54,063 --> 01:40:55,764
to provoke surrender?

2247
01:40:55,797 --> 01:40:58,867
We intend to demonstrate it in the most unambiguous terms.

2248
01:40:58,900 --> 01:40:59,601
Twice.

2249
01:40:59,634 --> 01:41:01,703
Once to show the weapon's power

2250
01:41:01,736 --> 01:41:04,240
and a second to show that we can keep doing this

2251
01:41:04,273 --> 01:41:05,774
until they surrender.

2252
01:41:05,807 --> 01:41:09,178
We have a list of 12 cities to choose from...

2253
01:41:09,212 --> 01:41:11,114
Sorry, 11.

2254
01:41:11,147 --> 01:41:12,848
I've taken Kyoto off the list

2255
01:41:12,881 --> 01:41:16,685
due to its cultural significance to the Japanese people.

2256
01:41:16,718 --> 01:41:19,355
Also, my wife and I honeymooned there.

2257
01:41:19,388 --> 01:41:20,889
It's a magnificent city.

2258
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:26,162
Let me make this simple for you, gentlemen.

2259
01:41:26,195 --> 01:41:28,697
According to my intelligence, which I cannot share with you,

2260
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:31,167
the Japanese people will not surrender

2261
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:32,968
under any circumstances

2262
01:41:33,001 --> 01:41:36,405
short of a successful and total invasion of the home islands.

2263
01:41:36,439 --> 01:41:39,408
Many lives will be lost, American and Japanese.

2264
01:41:39,442 --> 01:41:41,676
The use of the atomic bomb on Japanese cities

2265
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:43,678
will save lives.

2266
01:41:43,712 --> 01:41:46,014
If we retain moral advantage.

2267
01:41:46,048 --> 01:41:48,184
-How so? -Well, if we use this weapon

2268
01:41:48,217 --> 01:41:51,154
without informing our allies, they'll see it as a threat.

2269
01:41:51,187 --> 01:41:52,355
And we'll be in an arms race.

2270
01:41:52,388 --> 01:41:54,457
How open can we be with the Soviets?

2271
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:56,058
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets

2272
01:41:56,092 --> 01:41:58,461
from becoming part of the atomic world.

2273
01:41:58,494 --> 01:42:00,795
We've been told they have no uranium.

2274
01:42:00,829 --> 01:42:02,030
You've been misinformed.

2275
01:42:02,064 --> 01:42:03,899
A Russian bomb is a matter of time.

2276
01:42:03,932 --> 01:42:07,336
The program needs to continue at full pace after the war.

2277
01:42:07,370 --> 01:42:09,971
Uh, Secretary Stimson, if I may...

2278
01:42:10,005 --> 01:42:14,009
Not all scientists on the project are in agreement.

2279
01:42:14,042 --> 01:42:16,912
In fact, this might be a moment to consider other opinions.

2280
01:42:16,945 --> 01:42:18,847
-If you talk a scientist in... -GROVES: The Manhattan Project

2281
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,249
has been plagued from the start

2282
01:42:20,283 --> 01:42:24,086
by certain scientists of doubtful discretion

2283
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:25,188
and uncertain loyalty.

2284
01:42:25,221 --> 01:42:27,456
One of them just tried to meet with the president.

2285
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:29,325
Now, we need these men,

2286
01:42:29,358 --> 01:42:30,892
but as soon as it's practical,

2287
01:42:30,926 --> 01:42:33,196
we should sever any such scientists from the program.

2288
01:42:33,229 --> 01:42:34,796
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

2289
01:42:35,931 --> 01:42:37,766
If a Russian bomb is inevitable,

2290
01:42:37,799 --> 01:42:41,070
perhaps we should invite their top scientists to Trinity.

2291
01:42:41,103 --> 01:42:43,406
President Truman has no intention

2292
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:45,006
of raising expectations

2293
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,842
that Stalin be included in the atomic project.

2294
01:42:47,876 --> 01:42:49,245
Informing him of our breakthrough

2295
01:42:49,278 --> 01:42:50,879
and presenting it as a means to win the war

2296
01:42:50,912 --> 01:42:53,815
need not make unkeepable promises.

2297
01:42:53,848 --> 01:42:55,384
But the Potsdam peace conference in July

2298
01:42:55,418 --> 01:42:57,320
will be President Truman's last chance

2299
01:42:57,353 --> 01:42:59,488
to have that conversation.

2300
01:42:59,522 --> 01:43:01,424
Can you give us a working bomb by then?

2301
01:43:02,391 --> 01:43:06,128
Absolutely. We will test fire before the conference.

2302
01:43:06,995 --> 01:43:09,831
(suspenseful music playing)

2303
01:43:10,865 --> 01:43:13,402
<i>Ground zero observation posts</i>

2304
01:43:13,436 --> 01:43:14,903
<i>at 10,000 yards</i>

2305
01:43:14,936 --> 01:43:17,106
north, south and west.

2306
01:43:17,139 --> 01:43:20,443
-Where do we trigger from? -Uh, south 10,000.

2307
01:43:20,476 --> 01:43:23,812
And base camp is ten miles south, here.

2308
01:43:23,845 --> 01:43:26,781
And there's a further observation post

2309
01:43:26,815 --> 01:43:28,984
on-on that hill 20 miles away.

2310
01:43:29,017 --> 01:43:31,987
What's that, Frank? Trigger lines already went in.

2311
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:35,524
The Air Force requested a line of lights for their B-29.

2312
01:43:35,558 --> 01:43:37,993
What B-29? Our bomb's on the tower.

2313
01:43:38,026 --> 01:43:39,395
They want to use the test

2314
01:43:39,428 --> 01:43:41,264
to confirm a safe operating distance.

2315
01:43:41,297 --> 01:43:42,531
That's risky.

2316
01:43:42,565 --> 01:43:44,200
Not as risky as dropping one over Japan

2317
01:43:44,233 --> 01:43:46,001
and hoping that we were right about the blast radius.

2318
01:43:46,034 --> 01:43:48,137
Don't let them slow us down, we're firing on the 15th.

2319
01:43:48,170 --> 01:43:51,407
-The 15th? That's not... -GROVES: The 15th.

2320
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,775
The 15th.

2321
01:43:54,876 --> 01:43:56,811
So I'll be here at South Observation point

2322
01:43:56,845 --> 01:43:59,048
<i>with Frank and Kistiakowsky.</i>

2323
01:43:59,081 --> 01:44:01,584
You'll all be assigned to Base Camp,

2324
01:44:01,617 --> 01:44:04,819
West Observation or Far Observation.

2325
01:44:04,853 --> 01:44:07,922
(suspenseful music continues)

2326
01:44:14,463 --> 01:44:16,365
Whoa, whoa. Careful with the knife.

2327
01:44:16,399 --> 01:44:18,833
There, carefully.

2328
01:44:19,934 --> 01:44:21,470
Are those safe distances?

2329
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:24,005
They're based on your calculations.

2330
01:44:24,039 --> 01:44:26,941
Time to stand behind your science, Hans. Literally.

2331
01:44:29,010 --> 01:44:31,147
(suspenseful music continues)

2332
01:44:50,366 --> 01:44:51,833
Yeah.

2333
01:44:56,505 --> 01:44:58,341
What 'bout the radiation cloud?

2334
01:44:58,374 --> 01:44:59,608
Without high winds,

2335
01:44:59,642 --> 01:45:01,210
it should settle within two to three miles.

2336
01:45:01,243 --> 01:45:03,646
Evacuation measures are in place.

2337
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:05,481
But we need good weather for visibility,

2338
01:45:05,514 --> 01:45:06,981
so it has to be fine.

2339
01:45:08,084 --> 01:45:09,352
Everybody out.

2340
01:45:10,619 --> 01:45:12,921
(suspenseful music continues)

2341
01:45:19,528 --> 01:45:20,663
We go on the night of the 15th.

2342
01:45:20,696 --> 01:45:22,631
It's a hard deadline,

2343
01:45:22,665 --> 01:45:25,967
so if anyone has anything, speak now.

2344
01:45:26,669 --> 01:45:28,002
Okay, stop, stop.

2345
01:45:28,036 --> 01:45:29,904
Everybody, mattresses.

2346
01:45:29,938 --> 01:45:32,006
Put the mattress underneath.

2347
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:51,893
Could use a final implosion test.

2348
01:45:52,595 --> 01:45:54,563
It couldn't hurt.

2349
01:45:54,597 --> 01:45:56,098
Do it.

2350
01:45:57,066 --> 01:45:59,368
Is there anything else that might stop us?

2351
01:45:59,402 --> 01:46:01,070
(thunder rumbling)

2352
01:46:17,586 --> 01:46:20,222
(suspenseful music continues)

2353
01:46:33,469 --> 01:46:36,372
It's happening, isn't it?

2354
01:46:37,473 --> 01:46:39,241
I'll send a message.

2355
01:46:40,109 --> 01:46:42,745
If it's gone our way, take in the sheets.

2356
01:46:42,778 --> 01:46:44,346
take in the sheets.

2357
01:46:48,384 --> 01:46:49,418
Robert?

2358
01:46:52,087 --> 01:46:53,522
Break a leg.

2359
01:46:59,495 --> 01:47:01,664
(suspenseful music continues)

2360
01:47:01,697 --> 01:47:04,133
(explosion)

2361
01:47:07,303 --> 01:47:08,604
(mutters)

2362
01:47:08,637 --> 01:47:10,539
(wind gusting)

2363
01:47:35,764 --> 01:47:38,032
(wind whistling)

2364
01:47:43,305 --> 01:47:44,440
(sighs)

2365
01:47:52,147 --> 01:47:54,316
(thunder rumbling)

2366
01:48:00,089 --> 01:48:03,225
Oppie's taken a very modest three kilotons.

2367
01:48:03,259 --> 01:48:05,628
-Teller's in with 45. -RABI: 20.

2368
01:48:05,661 --> 01:48:08,097
Twenty thousand tons of TNT,

2369
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:09,532
and does anyone want the side action

2370
01:48:09,565 --> 01:48:12,301
-on atmospheric ignition? -(all laughing)

2371
01:48:13,269 --> 01:48:16,205
Are you saying we'll have to delay?

2372
01:48:16,238 --> 01:48:17,406
I'm saying it would be prudent.

2373
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:18,674
This weather, has it reached the site?

2374
01:48:18,707 --> 01:48:20,543
(tense music playing)

2375
01:48:20,576 --> 01:48:22,811
(thunder rumbling)

2376
01:48:22,845 --> 01:48:24,480
(telephone ringing)

2377
01:48:24,513 --> 01:48:26,482
Bethe is calling to tell you the implosion test failed.

2378
01:48:26,515 --> 01:48:28,150
Hello, Hans.

2379
01:48:28,183 --> 01:48:29,585
Yes, he's here.

2380
01:48:30,419 --> 01:48:31,754
Yes.

2381
01:48:31,787 --> 01:48:34,290
(thunder rumbling)

2382
01:48:34,323 --> 01:48:35,524
-Is he wrong? -No.

2383
01:48:35,558 --> 01:48:37,459
-No? -No.

2384
01:48:38,294 --> 01:48:39,862
So we're about to fire a dud?

2385
01:48:39,895 --> 01:48:41,363
-No. -Explain.

2386
01:48:41,397 --> 01:48:44,166
Well, I can't. I just... I-I just know.

2387
01:48:44,199 --> 01:48:45,868
I know the implosion lenses will work.

2388
01:48:45,901 --> 01:48:47,303
If we fire these detonators

2389
01:48:47,336 --> 01:48:48,571
and they don't trigger a reaction,

2390
01:48:48,604 --> 01:48:50,272
two years' worth of plutonium will be scattered across White Sands.

2391
01:48:50,306 --> 01:48:51,707
will be scattered across White Sands.

2392
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:55,644
A month of my salary against ten bucks says it lights.

2393
01:48:55,678 --> 01:48:57,680
-Jesus. -(thunder rumbling)

2394
01:48:57,713 --> 01:49:00,215
(tense music continues)

2395
01:49:02,751 --> 01:49:05,888
The wind's picking up at zero, not the rain.

2396
01:49:05,921 --> 01:49:07,356
Lightning's circling.

2397
01:49:07,389 --> 01:49:08,824
You think it might be time to tell your men

2398
01:49:08,857 --> 01:49:11,760
to get away from the steel tower with the atomic bomb?

2399
01:49:11,794 --> 01:49:14,263
(laughter)

2400
01:49:14,897 --> 01:49:16,865
Let's get to South Observation.

2401
01:49:16,899 --> 01:49:18,367
Pull 'em out.

2402
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:19,802
We can make our determination there.

2403
01:49:19,835 --> 01:49:22,304
(tense music continues)

2404
01:49:25,207 --> 01:49:27,209
The team hasn't slept in two nights.

2405
01:49:27,242 --> 01:49:29,244
If we stand down, make the bomb safe,

2406
01:49:29,278 --> 01:49:30,613
we won't be back here for weeks.

2407
01:49:30,646 --> 01:49:32,314
Then we'll miss Potsdam.

2408
01:49:32,348 --> 01:49:34,249
I gotta get word to Truman by 7:00.

2409
01:49:34,283 --> 01:49:35,517
Our window's closing.

2410
01:49:35,551 --> 01:49:36,619
What is this doing?

2411
01:49:36,652 --> 01:49:38,153
Raining, blowing, lightning.

2412
01:49:38,187 --> 01:49:40,222
-For how long, damn it? -It's holdin' strong.

2413
01:49:40,255 --> 01:49:41,557
It'll break before dawn.

2414
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:43,258
-How could you know that? -I know this desert.

2415
01:49:43,292 --> 01:49:44,393
Storm cools overnight.

2416
01:49:44,426 --> 01:49:46,228
Just before dawn, the storm breaks.

2417
01:49:46,261 --> 01:49:48,464
He could be right, but schedule as late as possible.

2418
01:49:48,497 --> 01:49:50,232
5:30!

2419
01:49:50,265 --> 01:49:51,300
Sign your forecast.

2420
01:49:51,333 --> 01:49:52,401
If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

2421
01:49:52,434 --> 01:49:54,236
Frank, tell them all, 5:30.

2422
01:49:54,269 --> 01:49:56,405
-5:30, 5:30. -MAN: 5:30.

2423
01:49:58,607 --> 01:50:03,545
Three years,
4,000 people, $2 billion.

2424
01:50:03,579 --> 01:50:05,948
Well, if it doesn't go off... (sighs)

2425
01:50:05,981 --> 01:50:07,583
we're both finished.

2426
01:50:08,651 --> 01:50:10,319
(thunder rumbling)

2427
01:50:10,352 --> 01:50:12,321
I'm betting on three kilotons.

2428
01:50:13,288 --> 01:50:14,723
Anything less, they won't get what it is.

2429
01:50:14,757 --> 01:50:19,328
What did Fermi mean by "atmospheric ignition"?

2430
01:50:19,361 --> 01:50:20,829
Well, we had a moment where it looked like

2431
01:50:20,863 --> 01:50:24,700
the chain reaction from an atomic device might never stop.

2432
01:50:25,934 --> 01:50:27,970
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

2433
01:50:28,003 --> 01:50:29,972
Why is Fermi still taking side bets on it?

2434
01:50:30,005 --> 01:50:33,175
Call it gallows humor.

2435
01:50:35,511 --> 01:50:38,313
Wait, are we saying there's a chance

2436
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:40,215
that when we push that button,

2437
01:50:40,249 --> 01:50:41,583
we destroy the world?

2438
01:50:41,617 --> 01:50:43,786
Nothing in our research over three years

2439
01:50:43,819 --> 01:50:45,454
supports that conclusion.

2440
01:50:45,487 --> 01:50:48,457
Except as the most remote possibility.

2441
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:49,825
How remote?

2442
01:50:49,858 --> 01:50:51,460
Chances are near zero.

2443
01:50:52,795 --> 01:50:54,196
Near zero?

2444
01:50:54,963 --> 01:50:57,533
What do you want from theory alone?

2445
01:50:57,566 --> 01:50:59,001
(scoffs)

2446
01:50:59,034 --> 01:51:01,403
Zero would be nice.

2447
01:51:04,707 --> 01:51:06,341
In exactly

2448
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:09,678
one hour, 58 minutes,

2449
01:51:09,712 --> 01:51:11,246
we'll know.

2450
01:51:17,286 --> 01:51:18,487
It's letting up.

2451
01:51:19,755 --> 01:51:22,224
(tense music continues)

2452
01:51:31,366 --> 01:51:33,736
The arming party's left Zero, they're heading this way.

2453
01:51:33,769 --> 01:51:34,737
Throwing the switches.

Everybody take a welder's glass.

Twenty minutes.

2465

That's 20.

-Feynman. -No.

The glass. Stops the U.V.

2469

And what stops the glass?

2470
01:53:28,817 --> 01:53:31,787

If the detonators don't charge

Yeah.

We can't say anything.

Tell her to take in the sheets.

2557

02:00:40,182 --> 02:00:43,085
Did Truman brief Stalin at Potsdam?

2573
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:45,854
A brief would be an overstatement.

2574
02:00:45,887 --> 02:00:49,958
He referred to a powerful new weapon.

2575
02:00:49,991 --> 02:00:55,064
Stalin hoped we'd use it against Japan.

2576

That's it?

2577

It's up to the CO in the Pacific.

2581
02:01:12,881 --> 02:01:14,116
What for?

2582
02:01:16,385 --> 02:01:17,986
Well, you'll keep me informed.

2583
02:01:19,322 --> 02:01:20,955
Of course.

2584
02:01:22,525 --> 02:01:24,126

Would the Japanese surrender if they knew what was coming?

2587
02:01:45,648 --> 02:01:47,249
I don't know.

2588
02:01:49,652 --> 02:01:51,654
Have you seen Szilard's petition?

2589
02:01:51,687 --> 02:01:54,423
What the hell does Szilard know about the Japanese?

2590
02:01:54,457 --> 02:01:55,658
You're not signing it, are you?

2591
02:01:55,691 --> 02:01:59,095
Many people have. A lot of people have.

Edward.

2593
02:02:01,530 --> 02:02:03,199
The fact that we built this bomb

2594
02:02:03,232 --> 02:02:06,235
does not give us any more... any more right or responsibility

2595
02:02:06,268 --> 02:02:08,371
to decide how it's used than anyone else.

2596
02:02:08,404 --> 02:02:10,406
But we're the only people who know about it.

2597
02:02:10,439 --> 02:02:14,008
I've told Stimson the various opinions of the community.

2598
02:02:14,042 --> 02:02:15,444
But what's your opinion?

2599
02:02:16,679 --> 02:02:18,214
Once it's used...

2600
02:02:19,315 --> 02:02:23,017
...nuclear war, perhaps all war...

2601
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:26,055
...becomes unthinkable.

2602
02:02:26,088 --> 02:02:29,091
Until somebody builds a bigger bomb.

2603
02:02:49,678 --> 02:02:51,414
I thought they would call.

2604
02:02:51,447 --> 02:02:53,014
It's only the 5th.

2605
02:02:55,184 --> 02:02:57,186
In Japan, it's the 6th.

TRUMAN (on radio): Sixteen hours ago,

(elated laughter outside)

2615

The bomb had more power than 20,000 tons of TNT.

2616
02:03:45,701 --> 02:03:48,170
It is an atomic bomb.

02:04:02,318 --> 02:04:04,620
and completely the Japanese...

2623
02:04:04,653 --> 02:04:06,322
(clears throat) General?

2624
02:04:06,355 --> 02:04:09,391
I'm very proud of you and all of your people.

2625
02:04:09,425 --> 02:04:10,759
It went all right?

2626
02:04:10,793 --> 02:04:13,762
Apparently, it went with a tremendous bang.

2627
02:04:13,796 --> 02:04:15,431
Well,

2628
02:04:15,464 --> 02:04:18,400
everyone here is feeling reasonably good about it.

2629
02:04:19,835 --> 02:04:21,470
It's been a long road.

2630
02:04:21,504 --> 02:04:24,306
I think one of the wisest things I ever did

2631
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:27,376
was when I selected the director of Los Alamos.

2632

-(cheering) -(car horns honking)

<i>We have spent</i>

It's too soon to...

2656
02:06:34,269 --> 02:06:35,938
It's too soon to determine

2657
02:06:35,971 --> 02:06:38,340
what the results of the bombing are.

2658
02:06:41,276 --> 02:06:42,878
But I'll bet the Japanese didn't like it.

I'm so proud.

2664
02:07:06,435 --> 02:07:08,570
So proud of what you have accomplished.

2665
02:07:09,938 --> 02:07:12,207
(continues breathing heavily)

2666
02:07:14,877 --> 02:07:18,714
I just wish we had it in time to use against the Germans.

2667
02:07:24,253 --> 02:07:26,655
(continues breathing heavily)

Dr. Oppenheimer?

Dr. Oppenheimer? (chuckles)

2679
02:09:13,362 --> 02:09:15,030
-Nice picture. -Oh.

2680
02:09:15,064 --> 02:09:17,399
President Truman will see you now.

2681
02:09:20,103 --> 02:09:21,737
(clears throat)

2682
02:09:31,114 --> 02:09:33,949
Dr. Oppenheimer. It's an honor.

2683
02:09:33,982 --> 02:09:35,918
-Mr. President. -TRUMAN: Please.

2684
02:09:35,951 --> 02:09:37,753
Thank you.

2685
02:09:37,786 --> 02:09:39,321
Secretary Byrnes.

2686
02:09:40,522 --> 02:09:42,524
How's it feel to be

2687
02:09:42,558 --> 02:09:44,593
the most famous man in the world?

2688
02:09:45,594 --> 02:09:48,664
You helped save a lot of American lives.

2689
02:09:48,697 --> 02:09:51,067
What we did at Hiroshima was a...

2690
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:53,035
And Nagasaki.

2691
02:09:53,069 --> 02:09:55,071
Well, obviously.

2692
02:09:55,104 --> 02:09:59,041
Your invention let us bring our boys home.

2693
02:09:59,075 --> 02:10:02,444
Well, it was hardly my invention.

2694
02:10:02,477 --> 02:10:04,746
It was you on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

2695
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:07,583
(both chuckling)

2696
02:10:07,616 --> 02:10:09,152
Jim tells me you're concerned

2697
02:10:09,185 --> 02:10:10,953
about an arms race with the Soviets.

2698
02:10:10,986 --> 02:10:13,355
Uh, yes, uh...

2699
02:10:14,057 --> 02:10:15,557
Well, um,

2700
02:10:15,591 --> 02:10:20,696
it's that, uh, now is our chance to secure

2701
02:10:20,729 --> 02:10:23,599
international cooperation on (clears throat) atomic energy,

2702
02:10:23,632 --> 02:10:26,668
and... and I'm concerned...

2703
02:10:26,702 --> 02:10:28,937
Do you know when the Soviets are gonna have the bomb?

2704
02:10:28,971 --> 02:10:30,906
I don't think I could give a...

2705
02:10:30,939 --> 02:10:32,342
Never.

2706
02:10:32,975 --> 02:10:34,610
Never.

2707
02:10:34,643 --> 02:10:37,813
Mr. President, the-the Russians have good physicists

2708
02:10:37,846 --> 02:10:39,481
and-and... and abundant resources.

2709
02:10:39,514 --> 02:10:41,617
-Abundant? (laughs) -Yes.

2710
02:10:41,650 --> 02:10:44,920
-I don't think so. -(chuckles)

2711
02:10:44,953 --> 02:10:48,490
Well, they'll-they'll put everything they have and...

2712
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:55,631
I hear you're leaving Los Alamos.

2713
02:10:56,899 --> 02:10:58,000
What should we do with it?

2714
02:10:58,033 --> 02:11:00,535
Give it back to the Indians.

2715
02:11:07,943 --> 02:11:11,180
Um... Dr. Oppenheimer, (sighs)

2716
02:11:11,214 --> 02:11:13,548
if what you say about the Soviets is true,

2717
02:11:13,582 --> 02:11:16,985
we have to build up Los Alamos,

2718
02:11:17,019 --> 02:11:18,921
not shut it down.

2719
02:11:22,158 --> 02:11:23,959
Uh, Mr. President...

2720
02:11:25,027 --> 02:11:26,528
Um...

2721
02:11:29,198 --> 02:11:32,868
I feel that I have blood on my hands.

2722
02:11:33,969 --> 02:11:36,972
(disquieting music playing)

2723
02:11:52,654 --> 02:11:57,960
You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki

2724
02:11:57,993 --> 02:12:01,029
gives a shit who built the bomb?

2725
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:06,568
They care who dropped it.

2726
02:12:07,270 --> 02:12:09,538
I did.

2727
02:12:10,772 --> 02:12:13,742
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2728
02:12:16,745 --> 02:12:18,081
(sniffs)

2729
02:12:19,881 --> 02:12:22,017
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2730
02:12:25,288 --> 02:12:26,755
(Truman clears throat)

2731
02:12:32,961 --> 02:12:35,764
Don't let that crybaby back in here.

2732
02:12:40,869 --> 02:12:43,905
<i>Robert saw that</i> <i>hand-wringing got him nowhere.</i>

2733
02:12:43,939 --> 02:12:47,276
<i>By the time I'd met him,</i> <i>he'd fully embraced</i>

2734
02:12:47,310 --> 02:12:49,878
<i>his "father of the bomb"</i> <i>reputation.</i>

2735
02:12:49,911 --> 02:12:52,315
Used his profile to influence policy.

2736
02:12:52,348 --> 02:12:54,883
(clamoring)

2737
02:13:01,790 --> 02:13:03,159
<i>Doctor, in the years</i> <i>following the war,</i>

2738
02:13:03,192 --> 02:13:05,328
would you say that you exerted a great influence

2739
02:13:05,361 --> 02:13:07,163
on the atomic policies of the USA?

2740
02:13:07,196 --> 02:13:09,898
<i>I think great</i> <i>would be an overstatement.</i>

2741
02:13:09,931 --> 02:13:11,900
Really? If we look at the issue of isotopes,

2742
02:13:11,933 --> 02:13:13,635
were you not personally responsible

2743
02:13:13,668 --> 02:13:15,704
for destroying all opposition to their export?

2744
02:13:15,737 --> 02:13:18,607
-Could use a-a bottle of beer... -(laughter)

2745
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:20,309
...when making atomic weapons. In fact, you do.

2746
02:13:20,343 --> 02:13:22,811
I was the spokesman, but the-the opinion

2747
02:13:22,844 --> 02:13:24,646
among scientists was unanimous.

2748
02:13:24,679 --> 02:13:26,349
All along with McCarthy on the rise,

2749
02:13:26,382 --> 02:13:27,783
he knew he was vulnerable.

2750
02:13:27,816 --> 02:13:29,185
His brother was blacklisted

2751
02:13:29,218 --> 02:13:32,121
by every university in the country.

2752
02:13:33,222 --> 02:13:36,059
Lomanitz wound up working the railroad, laying track.

2753
02:13:38,660 --> 02:13:40,096
And Chevalier went into exile.

2754
02:13:43,232 --> 02:13:44,666
But none of that

2755
02:13:44,699 --> 02:13:46,668
stopped Robert from pushing the GAC

2756
02:13:46,701 --> 02:13:49,571
to recommend arms control instead of the H-bomb.

2757
02:13:51,374 --> 02:13:52,841
He was devastated

2758
02:13:52,874 --> 02:13:54,943
when Truman rejected their recommendation.

2759
02:13:56,678 --> 02:13:59,215
I miss Richard more than I can bear.

2760
02:13:59,248 --> 02:14:01,016
I know, Ruth, I know.

2761
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:04,153
Part of me's glad he didn't live to see where this is all going.

2762
02:14:06,922 --> 02:14:08,357
Here comes the birthday boy.

2763
02:14:08,391 --> 02:14:10,992
-To gloat. -RUTH: Have fun.

2764
02:14:11,993 --> 02:14:14,363
Robert, uh, my son and his fiancée are desperate to meet

2765
02:14:14,397 --> 02:14:16,365
the father of the atomic bomb, and so...

2766
02:14:16,399 --> 02:14:19,202
Well. Good day.

2767
02:14:25,274 --> 02:14:27,376
Is this a bad time?

2768
02:14:27,410 --> 02:14:28,910
What do you think, Lewis?

2769
02:14:28,944 --> 02:14:31,012
Well, I think it must have been a blow for you.

2770
02:14:31,046 --> 02:14:33,182
For the world.

2771
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:34,850
The world?

2772
02:14:34,883 --> 02:14:38,854
What does Fuchs mean to the rest of the world?

2773
02:14:38,887 --> 02:14:40,289
Fuchs?

2774
02:14:40,323 --> 02:14:41,923
Klaus Fuchs?

2775
02:14:43,359 --> 02:14:45,760
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

2776
02:14:47,430 --> 02:14:48,897
(sighs)

2777
02:14:48,930 --> 02:14:50,799
Klaus Fuchs, the British scientist that you put

2778
02:14:50,832 --> 02:14:53,869
onto the implosion team at Los Alamos,

2779
02:14:53,902 --> 02:14:56,037
<i>turns out he was...</i>

2780
02:14:56,072 --> 02:14:59,342
he was spying for the Soviets the whole time.

2781
02:14:59,375 --> 02:15:00,909
I'm sorry.

2782
02:15:03,912 --> 02:15:06,047
(brooding music playing)

2783
02:15:06,082 --> 02:15:08,984
<i>After the truth</i> <i>about Fuchs came out,</i>

2784
02:15:09,017 --> 02:15:11,120
the FBI stepped up surveillance on him.

2785
02:15:11,154 --> 02:15:15,023
He knew his phone was tapped, he was followed everywhere...

2786
02:15:16,392 --> 02:15:17,826
...his trash picked through.

2787
02:15:21,830 --> 02:15:23,299
But never stopped speaking his mind.

2788
02:15:23,332 --> 02:15:26,001
A man of conviction.

2789
02:15:26,034 --> 02:15:28,870
And maybe he thought fame could actually protect him.

2790
02:15:30,373 --> 02:15:33,808
When Eisenhower took office, he saw one more chance.

2791
02:15:35,211 --> 02:15:36,245
He took it.

2792
02:15:36,279 --> 02:15:38,747
America and Russia

2793
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:43,052
may be likened to two scorpions in a bottle,

2794
02:15:43,085 --> 02:15:46,455
each capable of killing the other

2795
02:15:46,489 --> 02:15:49,192
but only at the risk of his own life.

2796
02:15:49,225 --> 02:15:51,993
Now, there are various aspects of this policy...

2797
02:15:52,027 --> 02:15:54,029
<i>Lot of scientists blame me,</i>

2798
02:15:54,063 --> 02:15:57,200
<i>but how was I supposed</i> <i>to protect him?</i>

2799
02:15:57,233 --> 02:15:59,202
...too secret for discussion,

2800
02:15:59,235 --> 02:16:01,237
candor is the only remedy.

2801
02:16:01,270 --> 02:16:02,804
Officials in Washington

2802
02:16:02,837 --> 02:16:04,340
need to start leveling with the American people.

2803
02:16:04,373 --> 02:16:06,007
(people murmuring)

2804
02:16:06,041 --> 02:16:08,877
That was the last straw for Robert's enemies.

2805
02:16:08,910 --> 02:16:10,946
So he had to lose his security clearance.

2806
02:16:10,979 --> 02:16:13,748
-And with it, his credibility. -(knocking)

2807
02:16:13,782 --> 02:16:16,185
But how could they do it?

2808
02:16:16,219 --> 02:16:17,486
He was a war hero.

2809
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:19,222
He'd already told everyone about his past.

2810
02:16:19,255 --> 02:16:21,224
Borden dredged it all up.

2811
02:16:21,257 --> 02:16:24,493
How could Borden get access to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2812
02:16:24,527 --> 02:16:26,095
Could it have been Nichols?

2813
02:16:26,128 --> 02:16:28,431
No, I can't imagine he'd do that.

2814
02:16:28,464 --> 02:16:30,499
But whoever did unleashed a firestorm

2815
02:16:30,533 --> 02:16:32,535
that burned a path from the White House

2816
02:16:32,568 --> 02:16:35,238
back to my desk at the AEC.

2817
02:16:35,271 --> 02:16:37,106
You see them in there, right?

2818
02:16:37,139 --> 02:16:41,009
I've been working my whole life to get here.

2819
02:16:41,042 --> 02:16:43,079
Cabinet of the United States of America.

2820
02:16:43,112 --> 02:16:45,046
Now, in front of the entire country,

2821
02:16:45,081 --> 02:16:47,149
they're gonna put me back in my place.

2822
02:16:48,584 --> 02:16:51,254
A lowly shoe salesman.

2823
02:16:51,287 --> 02:16:53,122
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2824
02:16:53,155 --> 02:16:55,224
I-I think we can get the Senate to grasp

2825
02:16:55,258 --> 02:16:58,060
that you did your duty, painful though it was.

2826
02:16:58,094 --> 02:16:59,861
Now, will Hill's testimony back us up?

2827
02:16:59,894 --> 02:17:01,863
-COUNSEL: Hill will be fine. -I don't really know him,

2828
02:17:01,896 --> 02:17:04,066
but, uh, he was one of Szilard's boys in Chicago,

2829
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:06,135
and they never forgave Robert for not supporting

2830
02:17:06,168 --> 02:17:08,571
their petition against bombing Japan.

2831
02:17:08,604 --> 02:17:13,808
This was taken 31 days after the bombing.

2832
02:17:13,842 --> 02:17:16,579
Virtually everyone in the street,

2833
02:17:16,612 --> 02:17:18,847
for nearly a mile around,

2834
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:22,084
was instantly and seriously burned.

2835
02:17:22,118 --> 02:17:23,286
(people gasping)

2836
02:17:23,319 --> 02:17:27,856
The, uh, Japanese spoke of people who wore striped clothing

2837
02:17:27,889 --> 02:17:30,859
upon whom the skin was burned in stripes.

2838
02:17:31,926 --> 02:17:34,297
There were many who thought themselves lucky,

2839
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:37,032
who climbed out of the ruins of their homes

2840
02:17:37,066 --> 02:17:38,933
only slightly injured.

2841
02:17:40,069 --> 02:17:41,836
But they died anyway.

2842
02:17:42,505 --> 02:17:45,608
They died days or weeks later

2843
02:17:45,641 --> 02:17:48,977
from the radium-like rays emitted in great numbers

2844
02:17:49,010 --> 02:17:50,912
at the moment of the explosion.

2845
02:17:52,114 --> 02:17:54,183
Did you read this crap in the papers?

2846
02:17:54,216 --> 02:17:57,018
A British physicist is saying the atomic bombings

2847
02:17:57,053 --> 02:17:59,221
were not the last act of World War II

2848
02:17:59,255 --> 02:18:02,391
but the first act of this cold war with Russia.

2849
02:18:02,425 --> 02:18:03,892
Which physicist?

2850
02:18:03,925 --> 02:18:05,328
I think you knew him.

2851
02:18:05,361 --> 02:18:06,961
Patrick Blackett.

2852
02:18:08,197 --> 02:18:09,398
(scoffs)

2853
02:18:09,432 --> 02:18:10,999
He may not be wrong.

2854
02:18:11,032 --> 02:18:12,368
Stimson is now telling me

2855
02:18:12,401 --> 02:18:15,638
we bombed an enemy that was essentially defeated.

2856
02:18:15,671 --> 02:18:19,208
Robert, you've all the influence now.

2857
02:18:19,241 --> 02:18:20,942
Please.

2858
02:18:20,975 --> 02:18:23,079
Urge them to continue my research on the Super.

2859
02:18:23,112 --> 02:18:24,480
I neither can nor will, Edward.

2860
02:18:24,513 --> 02:18:26,615
Why not?

2861
02:18:26,649 --> 02:18:28,351
It's not the right use of our resources.

2862
02:18:28,384 --> 02:18:30,486
Is that what you really believe?

2863
02:18:30,519 --> 02:18:32,887
J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2864
02:18:32,921 --> 02:18:35,324
Sphinx-like guru of the atom.

2865
02:18:36,625 --> 02:18:38,394
Nobody knows what you believe.

2866
02:18:39,495 --> 02:18:41,364
Do you? Hmm?

2867
02:18:41,397 --> 02:18:44,100
<i>One final time,</i> <i>our program director,</i>

2868
02:18:44,133 --> 02:18:46,102
<i>Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.</i>

2869
02:18:46,135 --> 02:18:47,269
(applause)

2870
02:18:47,303 --> 02:18:49,071
<i>I hope that in years to come</i>

2871
02:18:49,105 --> 02:18:53,109
you will look back on your work here with pride.

2872
02:18:53,142 --> 02:18:55,511
But today, that pride must be tempered

2873
02:18:55,544 --> 02:18:57,879
with a profound concern.

2874
02:18:59,148 --> 02:19:00,949
If atomic weapons are to be added

2875
02:19:00,982 --> 02:19:03,386
to the arsenals of a warring world,

2876
02:19:03,419 --> 02:19:06,988
then the day will come when people will curse

2877
02:19:07,021 --> 02:19:08,424
the name of Los Alamos.

2878
02:19:12,428 --> 02:19:14,530
Uh, sorry, Admiral.

2879
02:19:14,563 --> 02:19:16,565
Stopped off to get this.

2880
02:19:16,599 --> 02:19:19,402
It seems pretty favorable.

2881
02:19:19,435 --> 02:19:20,536
There's Oppenheimer.

2882
02:19:20,569 --> 02:19:22,138
What's the caption?

2883
02:19:22,171 --> 02:19:25,006
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer, Strauss fought..."

2884
02:19:25,039 --> 02:19:26,542
(soft music plays)

2885
02:19:26,575 --> 02:19:28,144
"...and the US won."

2886
02:19:28,977 --> 02:19:30,246
That'll work.

2887
02:19:30,279 --> 02:19:32,515
Those were your words from the other day.

2888
02:19:32,548 --> 02:19:33,948
We needed to pivot.

2889
02:19:33,982 --> 02:19:35,251
But how would you know

2890
02:19:35,284 --> 02:19:37,086
what <i>Time</i> magazine's gonna write?

2891
02:19:37,119 --> 02:19:39,355
Henry Luce is a friend.

2892
02:19:45,494 --> 02:19:48,997
You sat here and let me tell you how it's done,

2893
02:19:49,030 --> 02:19:51,700
but you've been far ahead all along.

2894
02:19:51,734 --> 02:19:54,703
Survival in Washington

2895
02:19:54,737 --> 02:19:57,072
is about knowing how to get things done.

2896
02:19:57,706 --> 02:19:59,108
SENATE AIDE: Right.

2897
02:20:00,709 --> 02:20:02,445
What was it you said about Borden?

2898
02:20:02,478 --> 02:20:05,481
"Why get caught holding the knife yourself?"

2899
02:20:05,514 --> 02:20:07,283
(sighs)

2900
02:20:07,316 --> 02:20:10,319
I'm beginning to think Borden was holding the knife for you.

2901
02:20:12,388 --> 02:20:14,623
It's gonna come down to how much influence

2902
02:20:14,657 --> 02:20:16,725
Borden's been able to exert on Teller.

2903
02:20:16,759 --> 02:20:19,195
-(Kitty laughing) -Did I say something funny?

2904
02:20:19,228 --> 02:20:20,596
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden"

2905
02:20:20,629 --> 02:20:24,400
when we all know that it's Strauss.

2906
02:20:24,433 --> 02:20:26,402
Lewis brought me to Princeton, Kitty.

2907
02:20:26,435 --> 02:20:29,138
And then you humiliated him in front of Congress.

2908
02:20:29,171 --> 02:20:32,006
But more useful than a sandwich.

2909
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:34,176
(laughter)

2910
02:20:35,177 --> 02:20:36,345
-How'd I do? -MAN: I'll call recess,

2911
02:20:36,378 --> 02:20:37,480
ten minutes.

2912
02:20:37,513 --> 02:20:39,748
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2913
02:20:39,782 --> 02:20:41,015
That was six years ago.

2914
02:20:41,050 --> 02:20:42,751
You know, the truly vindictive,

2915
02:20:42,785 --> 02:20:44,386
patient as saints.

2916
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:47,223
Strauss has been perfectly clear that he is neutral.

2917
02:20:47,256 --> 02:20:50,759
-(glass shatters) -Wake up. It is Strauss.

2918
02:20:50,793 --> 02:20:53,729
It's always been Strauss, and you know it.

2919
02:20:53,762 --> 02:20:55,397
Why won't you fight him?

2920
02:20:56,432 --> 02:20:57,633
Christ's sake.

2921
02:20:57,666 --> 02:20:58,701
(door slams)

2922
02:20:58,734 --> 02:21:01,403
It wasn't Nichols or Hoover

2923
02:21:01,437 --> 02:21:03,105
or one of Truman's guys. It was you.

2924
02:21:03,138 --> 02:21:05,107
You gave the file to Borden.

2925
02:21:05,140 --> 02:21:06,775
You set him on Oppenheimer.

2926
02:21:06,809 --> 02:21:09,245
-You convinced him to... -(loudly): Borden...

2927
02:21:09,278 --> 02:21:11,180
(in normal tone): didn't take any convincing.

2928
02:21:11,213 --> 02:21:13,315
Take your time, use the entire file.

2929
02:21:13,349 --> 02:21:16,252
Write up your conclusion, send them to the FBI.

2930
02:21:16,285 --> 02:21:18,521
The material is obviously extensive,

2931
02:21:18,554 --> 02:21:21,223
but there's nothing new here.

2932
02:21:21,257 --> 02:21:22,791
Your conclusions will be.

2933
02:21:22,825 --> 02:21:25,127
And they'll have to be answered.

2934
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:26,629
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

2935
02:21:26,662 --> 02:21:30,266
Oppenheimer's too slippery for that self-promoting clown.

2936
02:21:30,299 --> 02:21:33,168
I've talked it over with Hoover, he'll hold McCarthy at bay

2937
02:21:33,202 --> 02:21:34,803
while you do this with the AEC.

2938
02:21:34,837 --> 02:21:36,672
-A trial. -No.

2939
02:21:36,705 --> 02:21:40,476
No trial. You can't give Oppenheimer a platform.

2940
02:21:40,509 --> 02:21:42,278
You can't martyr him.

2941
02:21:42,311 --> 02:21:45,481
We need a systematic destruction of Oppenheimer's credibility

2942
02:21:45,514 --> 02:21:49,084
so he can never again speak on matters of national security.

2943
02:21:49,118 --> 02:21:51,186
Then what?

2944
02:21:52,388 --> 02:21:55,758
A shabby little room, far from the limelight.

2945
02:21:55,791 --> 02:21:57,560
(speaking indistinctly)

2946
02:22:02,197 --> 02:22:03,465
<i>A simple bureaucratic procedure.</i>

2947
02:22:03,499 --> 02:22:06,135
His Q clearance is up for renewal.

2948
02:22:06,168 --> 02:22:09,138
You send your accusations to the FBI.

2949
02:22:10,773 --> 02:22:14,376
Hoover sends them to the AEC, you're forced to act.

2950
02:22:15,210 --> 02:22:16,512
You write up an indictment

2951
02:22:16,545 --> 02:22:18,180
<i>and tell Oppenheimer</i>

2952
02:22:18,213 --> 02:22:20,883
<i>his security clearance</i> <i>is not being renewed.</i>

2953
02:22:20,916 --> 02:22:22,451
<i>But offer him</i> <i>the chance to appeal.</i>

2954
02:22:22,484 --> 02:22:24,820
As you can see, Robert, it's not yet signed.

2955
02:22:24,853 --> 02:22:26,355
May I keep this?

2956
02:22:26,388 --> 02:22:27,323
No.

2957
02:22:27,356 --> 02:22:29,592
If you do decide to appeal,

2958
02:22:29,625 --> 02:22:31,160
they'll have to send you a copy.

2959
02:22:31,193 --> 02:22:34,430
When he appeals-- and trust me, he will--

2960
02:22:34,463 --> 02:22:36,865
-I appoint a board. -(indistinct conversation)

2961
02:22:36,899 --> 02:22:39,368
They will, of course, have counsel.

2962
02:22:39,401 --> 02:22:41,337
-NICHOLS: Prosecutor? -In all but name.

2963
02:22:41,370 --> 02:22:43,539
-NICHOLS: Who? -Roger Robb.

2964
02:22:43,572 --> 02:22:44,740
Ouch.

2965
02:22:44,773 --> 02:22:46,241
Robb will have security clearance

2966
02:22:46,275 --> 02:22:47,810
<i>to examine Oppenheimer's file.</i>

2967
02:22:47,843 --> 02:22:49,278
<i>As will the Gray board.</i>

2968
02:22:49,311 --> 02:22:50,679
Defense counsel will not.

2969
02:22:52,514 --> 02:22:53,916
A closed hearing.

2970
02:22:53,949 --> 02:22:55,184
<i>The so-called</i> <i>derogatory information</i>

2971
02:22:55,217 --> 02:22:57,386
in your indictment of me.

2972
02:22:57,419 --> 02:22:59,888
No audience. No reporters.

2973
02:22:59,922 --> 02:23:03,392
-No burden of proof. -No burden of proof?

2974
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:06,261
We're not convicting.

2975
02:23:06,962 --> 02:23:09,565
We're just denying.

2976
02:23:14,536 --> 02:23:17,306
What is it you said?

2977
02:23:17,339 --> 02:23:20,676
"This is just how the game is played."

2978
02:23:20,709 --> 02:23:23,679
Well, forgive my naivete.

2979
02:23:23,712 --> 02:23:25,681
Amateurs seek the sun.

2980
02:23:26,649 --> 02:23:27,716
Get eaten.

2981
02:23:28,784 --> 02:23:31,620
Power stays in the shadows.

2982
02:23:31,654 --> 02:23:35,357
But, sir, you're... you're out of the shadows now.

2983
02:23:35,391 --> 02:23:36,825
Yeah, that's why this has to work.

2984
02:23:36,859 --> 02:23:38,327
Well...

2985
02:23:39,628 --> 02:23:41,764
Teller's testifying this morning.

2986
02:23:41,797 --> 02:23:44,199
That'll help. And then...

2987
02:23:44,233 --> 02:23:45,668
Hill is in the afternoon.

2988
02:23:45,701 --> 02:23:48,170
Hill is gonna help us too.

2989
02:23:50,406 --> 02:23:53,575
As you can see, Robert, it's not yet signed.

2990
02:23:53,609 --> 02:23:54,643
May I keep this?

2991
02:23:54,677 --> 02:23:55,711
No.

2992
02:23:57,813 --> 02:23:59,815
If you do decide to appeal,

2993
02:23:59,848 --> 02:24:02,685
then they'll have to send you a copy.

2994
02:24:02,718 --> 02:24:05,220
(unsettling music playing)

2995
02:24:06,255 --> 02:24:08,557
Take my car and driver. I insist.

2996
02:24:13,295 --> 02:24:15,230
I'll have to consult my lawyers, Lewis.

2997
02:24:15,264 --> 02:24:17,966
Of course. But don't take too long.

2998
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,202
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

2999
02:24:26,341 --> 02:24:28,644
I'm sorry it's come to this, Robert.

3000
02:24:28,677 --> 02:24:29,712
I think it's wrong.

3001
02:24:29,745 --> 02:24:31,780
(unsettling music building)

3002
02:24:43,025 --> 02:24:44,460
<i>Nichols wants me to fight</i>

3003
02:24:44,493 --> 02:24:46,495
<i>so he can get it</i> <i>all on the record.</i>

3004
02:24:46,528 --> 02:24:48,397
Strauss wants me to walk away.

3005
02:24:48,430 --> 02:24:51,266
Strauss knows that you can't do that,

3006
02:24:51,300 --> 02:24:53,736
you'd be accepting the charges.

3007
02:24:53,769 --> 02:24:55,437
You'll lose your job.

3008
02:24:55,471 --> 02:24:57,740
You will lose your reputation. We'll lose our house.

3009
02:24:57,773 --> 02:25:00,476
Robert, we have to fight.

3010
02:25:01,310 --> 02:25:03,011
(smacks lips)

3011
02:25:03,045 --> 02:25:05,347
As AEC Counsel, I can't represent you.

3012
02:25:05,380 --> 02:25:06,915
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

3013
02:25:06,949 --> 02:25:08,484
Oh, he's good.

3014
02:25:08,517 --> 02:25:12,254
The best, but I have to warn you...

3015
02:25:12,921 --> 02:25:15,357
...this won't be a fair fight.

3016
02:25:15,390 --> 02:25:17,392
-(suspenseful music plays) -ROBB: <i>During your interview</i>

3017
02:25:17,426 --> 02:25:19,895
with Boris Pash in 1943, did you refer to microfilm?

3018
02:25:19,928 --> 02:25:21,430
-No. -Tab 11,

3019
02:25:21,463 --> 02:25:22,898
page one, paragraph three. You never said,

3020
02:25:22,931 --> 02:25:26,568
"Man at the consulate expert in the use of microfilm"?

3021
02:25:26,602 --> 02:25:27,936
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry. -No.

3022
02:25:27,970 --> 02:25:28,904
I would like to know what document

3023
02:25:28,937 --> 02:25:30,372
Mr. Robb is quoting from

3024
02:25:30,405 --> 02:25:31,673
and if we might be furnished with a copy.

3025
02:25:31,707 --> 02:25:33,776
The document is classified, Mr. Garrison.

3026
02:25:33,809 --> 02:25:35,644
I think we should get back to first-hand information.

3027
02:25:35,677 --> 02:25:37,045
This is first-hand.

3028
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:39,348
How so, Roger?

3029
02:25:40,716 --> 02:25:42,551
There was a recording of the interview.

3030
02:25:46,522 --> 02:25:48,423
You let my client sit here

3031
02:25:48,457 --> 02:25:49,958
and potentially perjure himself,

3032
02:25:49,992 --> 02:25:52,528
and all this time, you had a recording?

3033
02:25:52,561 --> 02:25:53,929
Nobody told your client

3034
02:25:53,962 --> 02:25:55,364
to misrepresent his former answers.

3035
02:25:55,397 --> 02:25:57,466
Misrepre... It-it was 12 years ago.

3036
02:25:57,499 --> 02:25:58,801
Can we hear this recording?

3037
02:25:58,834 --> 02:26:00,402
You don't have the clearance, Mr. Garrison.

3038
02:26:00,435 --> 02:26:02,071
But you're reading it into the record.

3039
02:26:02,105 --> 02:26:03,739
Please, please.

3040
02:26:03,772 --> 02:26:07,376
Is this proceeding interested in entrapment or in truth?

3041
02:26:07,409 --> 02:26:09,845
If it's truth, where's the disclosure?

3042
02:26:09,878 --> 02:26:11,513
Where's the witness list?

3043
02:26:11,547 --> 02:26:14,083
Mr. Garrison, this isn't a trial, as you are well aware.

3044
02:26:14,117 --> 02:26:15,984
Evidentiary rules do not apply.

3045
02:26:16,018 --> 02:26:17,886
We are dealing with national security.

3046
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:19,421
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

3047
02:26:19,454 --> 02:26:21,824
I fail to see how national security

3048
02:26:21,857 --> 02:26:23,559
prevents the prosecution from providing us

3049
02:26:23,592 --> 02:26:25,594
-with a list of witnesses. -Perhaps we are in need

3050
02:26:25,627 --> 02:26:26,929
-of a brief recess. -ROBERT: Gentlemen,

3051
02:26:26,962 --> 02:26:28,697
you have my words.

3052
02:26:28,730 --> 02:26:30,866
If you say they're from a transcript, then I'll accept it.

3053
02:26:30,899 --> 02:26:33,669
I've already explained I made up a cock-and-bull story.

3054
02:26:33,702 --> 02:26:37,039
But why would anyone make up such an elaborate story?

3055
02:26:37,073 --> 02:26:39,142
Because I was an idiot.

3056
02:26:39,175 --> 02:26:40,776
Why lie?

3057
02:26:40,809 --> 02:26:43,412
Well, clearly with the intention of not revealing

3058
02:26:43,445 --> 02:26:45,514
who the intermediary was.

3059
02:26:45,547 --> 02:26:47,583
Your friend, Haakon Chevalier, the Communist.

3060
02:26:47,616 --> 02:26:49,885
Is he still your friend?

3061
02:26:49,918 --> 02:26:51,353
Yes.

3062
02:26:53,455 --> 02:26:56,391
Dr. Rabi, thank you for coming.

3063
02:26:56,425 --> 02:26:58,127
Do you know who else the prosecution has called?

3064
02:26:58,161 --> 02:27:00,495
Teller, obviously.

3065
02:27:01,463 --> 02:27:02,731
They've asked Lawrence.

3066
02:27:02,764 --> 02:27:03,599
What did he say?

3067
02:27:03,632 --> 02:27:06,535
He wasn't going to help them, but...

3068
02:27:06,568 --> 02:27:07,502
But?

3069
02:27:07,536 --> 02:27:09,538
Strauss told him that you and Ruth Tolman

3070
02:27:09,571 --> 02:27:12,007
<i>have been having</i> <i>an affair for years.</i>

3071
02:27:12,040 --> 02:27:13,142
<i>The whole time you lived</i>

3072
02:27:13,176 --> 02:27:14,810
-with them in Pasadena. -(sighs)

3073
02:27:14,843 --> 02:27:16,511
He convinced Lawrence

3074
02:27:16,545 --> 02:27:18,114
that Richard died of a broken heart.

3075
02:27:18,147 --> 02:27:19,448
That's absurd.

3076
02:27:19,481 --> 02:27:22,017
-What part? -The broken heart.

3077
02:27:22,051 --> 02:27:24,087
Richard never found out.

3078
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:25,888
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

3079
02:27:25,921 --> 02:27:27,422
I don't know.

3080
02:27:27,956 --> 02:27:29,591
Dr. Rabi,

3081
02:27:29,625 --> 02:27:32,694
what governmental positions do you currently hold?

3082
02:27:32,728 --> 02:27:35,631
I am the chairman of the General Advisory Committee

3083
02:27:35,664 --> 02:27:38,567
to the AEC, succeeding Dr. Oppenheimer.

3084
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:41,436
And how long have you known Dr. Oppenheimer?

3085
02:27:41,470 --> 02:27:43,072
Since 1928.

3086
02:27:43,106 --> 02:27:45,174
I... I know him quite well.

3087
02:27:45,208 --> 02:27:47,176
Well enough to speak to the bearing

3088
02:27:47,210 --> 02:27:49,778
of his loyalty and character?

3089
02:27:49,811 --> 02:27:53,815
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man of upstanding character.

3090
02:27:53,849 --> 02:27:56,518
And he is loyal to the United States,

3091
02:27:56,551 --> 02:27:57,786
to his friends,

3092
02:27:57,819 --> 02:28:00,489
to the institutions of which he is part.

3093
02:28:01,957 --> 02:28:02,991
Eat.

3094
02:28:05,894 --> 02:28:06,929
(scoffs)

3095
02:28:08,097 --> 02:28:10,699
(suspenseful music continues)

3096
02:28:21,977 --> 02:28:23,679
-ROBERT: What was that? -(door closes)

3097
02:28:23,712 --> 02:28:25,747
Nothing to worry about.

3098
02:28:27,983 --> 02:28:29,718
<i>After the Russian A-bomb test,</i>

3099
02:28:29,751 --> 02:28:32,221
did Dr. Lawrence come to see you about the hydrogen bomb?

3100
02:28:32,255 --> 02:28:34,057
You'd be better off asking him.

3101
02:28:34,090 --> 02:28:35,624
Well, I fully intend to.

3102
02:28:35,657 --> 02:28:38,227
Would you say that Dr. Oppenheimer was

3103
02:28:38,261 --> 02:28:40,263
unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?

3104
02:28:40,296 --> 02:28:43,099
No, he-he thought that a fusion program

3105
02:28:43,132 --> 02:28:46,235
would come at the expense of our awfully good fission program.

3106
02:28:46,269 --> 02:28:48,104
But that proved not to be the case.

3107
02:28:48,137 --> 02:28:50,772
In the event both could be done.

3108
02:28:50,806 --> 02:28:53,109
Suppose that this board did not feel satisfied

3109
02:28:53,142 --> 02:28:54,277
that in his testimony here,

3110
02:28:54,310 --> 02:28:56,578
Dr. Oppenheimer had been wholly truthful.

3111
02:28:56,611 --> 02:28:59,815
What would you say whether or not he should be cleared?

3112
02:28:59,848 --> 02:29:01,750
Why go through all this against a man

3113
02:29:01,783 --> 02:29:03,986
who has accomplished what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

3114
02:29:04,019 --> 02:29:05,654
Look at his record.

3115
02:29:05,687 --> 02:29:07,756
We have an A-bomb and a whole series of it.

3116
02:29:07,789 --> 02:29:09,725
We have a whole series of Super bombs.

3117
02:29:09,758 --> 02:29:11,727
What more do you want?

3118
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:12,627
Mermaids?

3119
02:29:12,661 --> 02:29:14,963
But I've known Secretary Strauss

3120
02:29:14,997 --> 02:29:16,598
for many years,

3121
02:29:16,631 --> 02:29:19,901
and I feel it a necessity to express the warm support

3122
02:29:19,935 --> 02:29:22,604
for science and scientists Lewis has shown.

3123
02:29:22,637 --> 02:29:23,872
We'll break now,

3124
02:29:23,905 --> 02:29:25,707
unless there's any immediate business.

3125
02:29:25,741 --> 02:29:28,277
Senator, I'd like to once again request

3126
02:29:28,311 --> 02:29:30,979
that we're furnished with a list of witnesses.

3127
02:29:31,013 --> 02:29:33,782
And I will remind the nominee that we don't always

3128
02:29:33,815 --> 02:29:35,817
have that information in advance.

3129
02:29:35,851 --> 02:29:39,288
We do know that Dr. Hill will be here after lunch.

3130
02:29:39,322 --> 02:29:40,956
Mr. Chairman, our next scheduled witness,

3131
02:29:40,989 --> 02:29:45,527
Dr. Lawrence, has apparently come down with colitis.

3132
02:29:46,995 --> 02:29:49,898
So we'll proceed with William Borden instead.

3133
02:29:51,167 --> 02:29:52,567
Mr. Borden, welcome.

3134
02:29:52,601 --> 02:29:54,070
Please take a seat.

3135
02:29:55,238 --> 02:29:57,639
Mr. Borden,

3136
02:29:57,672 --> 02:30:00,243
during your investigation into Dr. Oppenheimer,

3137
02:30:00,276 --> 02:30:01,910
did you reach certain conclusions?

3138
02:30:01,943 --> 02:30:04,247
-I did. -And did there come a time

3139
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:05,747
when you expressed those conclusions

3140
02:30:05,781 --> 02:30:07,783
in a letter to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover

3141
02:30:07,816 --> 02:30:09,751
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

3142
02:30:09,785 --> 02:30:11,187
-BORDEN: That is correct. -Prior to the writing

3143
02:30:11,220 --> 02:30:12,988
of the letter, did you discuss the writing of the letter

3144
02:30:13,021 --> 02:30:15,324
with anybody attached to the Atomic Energy Commission?

3145
02:30:15,358 --> 02:30:16,958
I did not.

3146
02:30:16,992 --> 02:30:18,327
Thanks, and do you have a copy of the letter?

3147
02:30:18,361 --> 02:30:19,961
I have one in front of me.

3148
02:30:19,995 --> 02:30:22,098
Would you please be so kind as to read it, sir?

3149
02:30:22,131 --> 02:30:23,665
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

3150
02:30:23,698 --> 02:30:25,134
the purpose of this letter is to state..."

3151
02:30:25,168 --> 02:30:27,203
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, if I could have a...

3152
02:30:27,236 --> 02:30:29,604
What is the purpose of the delay?

3153
02:30:29,638 --> 02:30:31,107
He's simply gonna read the letter.

3154
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:32,674
(scoffs) Mr. Chairman,

3155
02:30:32,707 --> 02:30:34,709
this is the first I've seen of this letter,

3156
02:30:34,743 --> 02:30:36,011
and I see statements here, uh,

3157
02:30:36,044 --> 02:30:38,013
at least one, of a kind that I don't think

3158
02:30:38,046 --> 02:30:40,015
anyone would like to see go into the record.

3159
02:30:40,048 --> 02:30:42,818
These are accusations that have not previously been made.

3160
02:30:42,851 --> 02:30:44,786
That are not part of the indictment from Nichols.

3161
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:46,955
Accusations of a kind that I don't think belong here.

3162
02:30:46,988 --> 02:30:49,158
The witness wrote this letter on his own initiative,

3163
02:30:49,192 --> 02:30:51,760
laying out evidence that has already been before the board.

3164
02:30:51,793 --> 02:30:53,396
His conclusions are valid testimony,

3165
02:30:53,429 --> 02:30:55,331
just like the... the positive conclusions

3166
02:30:55,364 --> 02:30:56,698
of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

3167
02:30:56,731 --> 02:30:58,234
It cuts both ways.

3168
02:30:58,267 --> 02:31:00,702
How long has Counsel been in possession of this letter?

3169
02:31:00,735 --> 02:31:02,105
I don't think I should be subject

3170
02:31:02,138 --> 02:31:04,706
to cross-examination by you, Mr. Garrison.

3171
02:31:04,739 --> 02:31:06,375
Mr. Garrison, given that we on the board

3172
02:31:06,409 --> 02:31:07,909
have all read the letter,

3173
02:31:07,943 --> 02:31:10,279
wouldn't it be better to have it in the record?

3174
02:31:10,313 --> 02:31:11,780
Let's proceed.

3175
02:31:11,813 --> 02:31:13,748
(tense music playing)

3176
02:31:13,782 --> 02:31:15,251
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

3177
02:31:15,284 --> 02:31:18,720
"the purpose of this letter is to state my opinion

3178
02:31:18,753 --> 02:31:20,056
"based upon years of study

3179
02:31:20,089 --> 02:31:22,858
"of the available classified evidence,

3180
02:31:22,891 --> 02:31:24,926
"that more probably than not,

3181
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:29,831
"J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union.

3182
02:31:29,865 --> 02:31:32,201
"The following conclusions are justified.

3183
02:31:32,235 --> 02:31:37,073
"One, between 1929 and 1942, more probably than not,

3184
02:31:37,106 --> 02:31:38,407
"J. Robert Oppenheimer

3185
02:31:38,441 --> 02:31:40,742
"was a sufficiently hardened Communist,

3186
02:31:40,775 --> 02:31:42,878
"that he volunteered information to the Soviets.

3187
02:31:42,911 --> 02:31:45,248
"Two, more probably than not,

3188
02:31:45,281 --> 02:31:49,851
"he has since been functioning as an espionage agent.

3189
02:31:49,885 --> 02:31:52,721
"Three, more probably than not,

3190
02:31:52,754 --> 02:31:54,990
"he has since acted under a Soviet directive

3191
02:31:55,023 --> 02:31:57,759
in influencing United States military policy..."

3192
02:31:57,792 --> 02:31:59,027
I'm sorry, Robert.

3193
02:31:59,061 --> 02:32:00,396
"...atomic energy, intelligence

3194
02:32:00,429 --> 02:32:01,796
-and diplomatic policy." -Is anyone

3195
02:32:01,830 --> 02:32:03,466
ever going to tell the truth

3196
02:32:03,499 --> 02:32:05,268
about what's happening here?

3197
02:32:05,301 --> 02:32:08,837
CHAIRMAN MAGNUSON: <i>We will now</i> <i>hear from Dr. David Hill.</i>

3198
02:32:08,870 --> 02:32:11,274
(soft suspenseful music plays)

3199
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:19,415
Dr. Hill,

3200
02:32:19,448 --> 02:32:22,084
would you care to make a statement?

3201
02:32:23,219 --> 02:32:24,786
Thank you.

3202
02:32:24,819 --> 02:32:28,491
I've been asked to testify about Lewis Strauss.

3203
02:32:28,524 --> 02:32:30,926
A man who has given years of service

3204
02:32:30,959 --> 02:32:33,929
in high positions of government

3205
02:32:33,962 --> 02:32:38,900
and who is known to be earnest, hardworking and intelligent.

3206
02:32:39,901 --> 02:32:41,404
The views I have to express are my own,

3207
02:32:41,437 --> 02:32:45,141
but I believe that much I have to say will help to indicate

3208
02:32:45,174 --> 02:32:48,877
why most of the scientists in this country

3209
02:32:48,910 --> 02:32:51,913
would prefer to see Mr. Strauss

3210
02:32:51,947 --> 02:32:53,782
completely out of government.

3211
02:32:53,815 --> 02:32:55,784
(murmurs of surprise)

3212
02:32:55,817 --> 02:32:58,321
You're... You're referring to the hostility

3213
02:32:58,354 --> 02:32:59,821
of certain scientists

3214
02:32:59,854 --> 02:33:01,490
directed toward Mr. Strauss

3215
02:33:01,524 --> 02:33:03,758
because of his commitment to security

3216
02:33:03,792 --> 02:33:06,795
as demonstrated in the Oppenheimer affair?

3217
02:33:09,265 --> 02:33:10,533
No.

3218
02:33:10,566 --> 02:33:12,968
Because of the personal vindictiveness

3219
02:33:13,001 --> 02:33:15,238
he demonstrated against Dr. Oppenheimer.

3220
02:33:15,271 --> 02:33:16,871
(people exclaiming)

3221
02:33:16,905 --> 02:33:19,040
-MAGNUSON: Order. -(gavel banging)

3222
02:33:19,075 --> 02:33:20,109
Order!

3223
02:33:20,142 --> 02:33:25,414
It appears to most scientists around this country

3224
02:33:25,448 --> 02:33:26,982
that Robert Oppenheimer is now being

3225
02:33:27,015 --> 02:33:29,252
pilloried and put through an ordeal

3226
02:33:29,285 --> 02:33:32,388
because he expressed his honest opinions.

3227
02:33:33,389 --> 02:33:35,458
Dr. Bush, I thought I was performing a service

3228
02:33:35,491 --> 02:33:37,226
to my country when hearing this case.

3229
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:41,397
No board in this country should sit in judgment of a man

3230
02:33:41,430 --> 02:33:44,066
because he expressed strong opinions.

3231
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:47,169
If you want to try that case, you should try me.

3232
02:33:47,203 --> 02:33:51,207
Excuse me, gentlemen, if I become stirred,

3233
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:52,441
but I am.

3234
02:33:52,475 --> 02:33:54,443
Dr. Hill, we've already heard

3235
02:33:54,477 --> 02:33:56,911
that Mr. Strauss did not bring the charges

3236
02:33:56,945 --> 02:34:00,015
or participate in the hearings against Dr. Oppenheimer.

3237
02:34:00,048 --> 02:34:02,551
The Oppenheimer matter was

3238
02:34:02,585 --> 02:34:04,953
initiated and carried through

3239
02:34:04,986 --> 02:34:07,356
largely through the animus of Lewis Strauss.

3240
02:34:07,390 --> 02:34:08,923
(people exclaim)

3241
02:34:08,957 --> 02:34:11,594
Oppenheimer made mincemeat out of Strauss's position

3242
02:34:11,627 --> 02:34:13,229
on the shipment of isotopes to Norway,

3243
02:34:13,262 --> 02:34:17,266
and Strauss never forgave him this public humiliation.

3244
02:34:17,300 --> 02:34:19,901
Another controversy between them centered around

3245
02:34:19,934 --> 02:34:22,904
their differences in judgment on how the H-bomb

3246
02:34:22,937 --> 02:34:25,006
<i>would contribute</i> <i>to national security.</i>

3247
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,008
Strauss turned to the personnel security system

3248
02:34:27,042 --> 02:34:31,280
in order to destroy Oppenheimer's effectiveness,

3249
02:34:31,314 --> 02:34:33,848
and Strauss was able to find a few ambitious men

3250
02:34:33,882 --> 02:34:36,918
who also disagreed with Oppenheimer's positions

3251
02:34:36,951 --> 02:34:39,988
and envied him his prestige in government circles.

3252
02:34:40,021 --> 02:34:42,625
I've always assumed, and still assume,

3253
02:34:42,658 --> 02:34:44,893
that he's loyal to the United States.

3254
02:34:44,926 --> 02:34:46,329
I believe this. And I shall believe it

3255
02:34:46,362 --> 02:34:48,930
until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.

3256
02:34:48,963 --> 02:34:50,932
Do you or do you not believe

3257
02:34:50,965 --> 02:34:53,269
that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

3258
02:34:54,270 --> 02:34:55,371
(smacks lips)

3259
02:34:57,005 --> 02:34:58,274
In a great number of cases,

3260
02:34:58,307 --> 02:35:00,276
I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act in a way

3261
02:35:00,309 --> 02:35:04,180
which was to me exceedingly hard to understand.

3262
02:35:04,213 --> 02:35:06,215
I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues,

3263
02:35:06,248 --> 02:35:08,351
and his actions frankly appeared to me

3264
02:35:08,384 --> 02:35:09,918
confused and complicated.

3265
02:35:09,951 --> 02:35:11,487
To this extent, I feel,

3266
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:14,623
I want to see the vital interest of this country

3267
02:35:14,657 --> 02:35:16,492
in hands which I understand better

3268
02:35:16,525 --> 02:35:18,661
and therefore trust more.

3269
02:35:18,694 --> 02:35:21,464
-MORGAN: Thank you, Doctor. -ROBB: Thank you.

3270
02:35:25,267 --> 02:35:26,369
I'm sorry.

3271
02:35:29,003 --> 02:35:31,173
<i>You shook his fucking hand?</i>

3272
02:35:31,207 --> 02:35:34,110
Oh, I would have spit in his face.

3273
02:35:34,143 --> 02:35:35,678
Not sure the board would have appreciated that.

3274
02:35:35,711 --> 02:35:37,279
Is it not gentlemanly enough for you?

3275
02:35:37,313 --> 02:35:40,649
Well, I-I think you're all being too goddamn gentlemanly.

3276
02:35:40,683 --> 02:35:42,651
Gray must see what Robb is doing.

3277
02:35:42,685 --> 02:35:44,620
Why doesn't he just shut him down?

3278
02:35:44,653 --> 02:35:47,256
And you shaking Teller's hand.

3279
02:35:47,289 --> 02:35:50,159
You need to stop playing the martyr.

3280
02:35:51,160 --> 02:35:53,562
Under the current AEC guidelines,

3281
02:35:53,596 --> 02:35:55,997
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

3282
02:35:56,030 --> 02:35:58,334
(unnerving music playing)

3283
02:36:02,171 --> 02:36:04,540
Under my interpretation (sighs)

3284
02:36:04,573 --> 02:36:06,709
of the Atomic Energy Act,

3285
02:36:06,742 --> 02:36:08,577
which did not exist

3286
02:36:08,611 --> 02:36:11,447
when I hired Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942...

3287
02:36:12,681 --> 02:36:16,085
I would not clear him today,

3288
02:36:16,118 --> 02:36:18,087
uh, if I were on the commission.

3289
02:36:18,120 --> 02:36:19,688
Good. Thank you, General. That is all.

3290
02:36:19,722 --> 02:36:21,724
But I don't think I'd clear any of those guys.

3291
02:36:21,757 --> 02:36:23,925
That's all.

3292
02:36:26,429 --> 02:36:28,564
Dr. Oppenheimer had no responsibility

3293
02:36:28,597 --> 02:36:30,099
in the selection or the clearance

3294
02:36:30,132 --> 02:36:31,434
of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

3295
02:36:31,467 --> 02:36:32,735
No. None at all.

3296
02:36:32,768 --> 02:36:34,370
And you wouldn't want to leave this board

3297
02:36:34,403 --> 02:36:37,173
with any suggestion today that you're here questioning

3298
02:36:37,206 --> 02:36:39,241
his basic loyalty to the United States

3299
02:36:39,275 --> 02:36:40,676
in the operation of Los Alamos?

3300
02:36:40,709 --> 02:36:42,278
By no means.

3301
02:36:42,311 --> 02:36:44,313
I hope I didn't lead anyone to believe otherwise

3302
02:36:44,346 --> 02:36:45,980
for an instant.

3303
02:36:46,014 --> 02:36:47,116
Thank you, General.

3304
02:36:47,149 --> 02:36:50,186
(wistful music playing)

3305
02:37:05,167 --> 02:37:07,436
Okay. We shouldn't keep them waiting.

3306
02:37:07,470 --> 02:37:08,737
She'll be here.

3307
02:37:08,771 --> 02:37:10,206
Do you even want her here?

3308
02:37:10,239 --> 02:37:12,741
Only a fool or an adolescent

3309
02:37:12,775 --> 02:37:14,677
presumes to know someone else's relationship,

3310
02:37:14,710 --> 02:37:17,011
and you're neither, Lloyd.

3311
02:37:17,045 --> 02:37:18,547
(door shuts)

3312
02:37:18,581 --> 02:37:20,549
Kitty and I,

3313
02:37:20,583 --> 02:37:22,651
we're grown-ups.

3314
02:37:22,685 --> 02:37:25,521
<i>We've walked</i> <i>through fire together.</i>

3315
02:37:25,554 --> 02:37:28,123
She'll do fine.

3316
02:37:28,157 --> 02:37:30,226
Would you describe your views on Communism

3317
02:37:30,259 --> 02:37:32,294
as pro, anti, neutral?

3318
02:37:32,328 --> 02:37:34,196
Very strongly against.

3319
02:37:34,230 --> 02:37:36,365
I-I've had nothing to do with Communism in... since...

3320
02:37:36,398 --> 02:37:39,235
since 1936, since...

3321
02:37:39,268 --> 02:37:42,137
since before I met Robert.

3322
02:37:42,738 --> 02:37:44,573
That's all.

3323
02:37:44,607 --> 02:37:46,175
<i>The record demonstrates</i>

3324
02:37:46,208 --> 02:37:47,810
<i>that Oppenheimer</i> <i>was not interrogated</i>

3325
02:37:47,843 --> 02:37:51,080
<i>by impartial and disinterested</i> <i>counsel for the Gray board.</i>

3326
02:37:51,113 --> 02:37:52,515
<i>He was interrogated</i> <i>by a prosecutor</i>

3327
02:37:52,548 --> 02:37:54,216
<i>who used all the tricks</i>

3328
02:37:54,250 --> 02:37:56,051
<i>of a rather ingenious</i> <i>legal background.</i>

3329
02:37:56,085 --> 02:37:57,520
SENATOR SCOTT: You are charging now

3330
02:37:57,553 --> 02:38:00,523
that the Gray board permitted a prosecution.

3331
02:38:00,556 --> 02:38:03,259
If I were on the Gray board,

3332
02:38:03,292 --> 02:38:05,261
I would have protested against the tactics

3333
02:38:05,294 --> 02:38:08,197
of the man who served, in fact, as the prosecuting counsel.

3334
02:38:08,230 --> 02:38:11,433
A man appointed not by the board

3335
02:38:11,467 --> 02:38:13,536
but by Lewis Strauss.

3336
02:38:13,569 --> 02:38:15,504
(people exclaim)

3337
02:38:15,538 --> 02:38:16,572
Who was this?

3338
02:38:17,873 --> 02:38:19,708
I'm sorry?

3339
02:38:19,742 --> 02:38:20,809
Who was this?

3340
02:38:20,843 --> 02:38:22,278
Uh, Roger Robb.

3341
02:38:22,311 --> 02:38:24,647
-(chair scrapes) -Mrs. Oppenheimer.

3342
02:38:26,582 --> 02:38:28,817
(pensive music playing)

3343
02:38:28,851 --> 02:38:31,287
Did you have a Communist Party membership card?

3344
02:38:32,721 --> 02:38:34,823
I'm... I'm not sure.

3345
02:38:34,857 --> 02:38:36,358
Not sure?

3346
02:38:39,328 --> 02:38:40,329
Well...

3347
02:38:42,731 --> 02:38:44,466
-(sighs) -ROBB: Well?

3348
02:38:53,409 --> 02:38:56,378
I mean, presumably, the act of joining the Party

3349
02:38:56,412 --> 02:39:00,182
required sending some money and receiving a card, no?

3350
02:39:03,352 --> 02:39:04,486
Yeah.

3351
02:39:07,556 --> 02:39:09,258
(sighs)

3352
02:39:09,858 --> 02:39:11,260
(softly): Sorry.

3353
02:39:11,894 --> 02:39:13,495
Yes. Mm.

3354
02:39:15,331 --> 02:39:17,333
It's just it was all so very long ago,

3355
02:39:17,366 --> 02:39:19,201
-Mr. Robb, wasn't it? -Not really.

3356
02:39:19,234 --> 02:39:20,469
Long enough to have forgotten.

3357
02:39:20,502 --> 02:39:21,870
Did you return the card or rip it up?

3358
02:39:21,904 --> 02:39:23,505
The card whose existence I've forgotten?

3359
02:39:23,539 --> 02:39:25,341
Your Communist Party membership card.

3360
02:39:25,374 --> 02:39:27,109
Haven't the slightest idea.

3361
02:39:29,411 --> 02:39:32,181
Can a distinction be made between

3362
02:39:32,214 --> 02:39:33,882
Soviet Communism and Communism?

3363
02:39:33,916 --> 02:39:35,484
Well, in the days when I was a member,

3364
02:39:35,517 --> 02:39:37,152
I thought they were definitely two things.

3365
02:39:37,186 --> 02:39:38,454
-Oh? -I thought that

3366
02:39:38,487 --> 02:39:40,356
the Communist Party of the United States

3367
02:39:40,389 --> 02:39:42,791
was concerned with our domestic problems.

3368
02:39:42,825 --> 02:39:44,293
I now no longer believe this.

3369
02:39:44,326 --> 02:39:45,361
Believe the whole thing's linked together

3370
02:39:45,394 --> 02:39:46,662
and spread all over the world,

3371
02:39:46,695 --> 02:39:48,897
and I have believed this since I left the Party

3372
02:39:48,931 --> 02:39:50,399
16 years ago.

3373
02:39:50,432 --> 02:39:51,734
-But... -Seventeen years ago.

3374
02:39:51,767 --> 02:39:53,168
My mistake.

3375
02:39:53,202 --> 02:39:55,838
-But you said... -Sorry, 18.

3376
02:39:55,871 --> 02:39:58,140
Eighteen years ago.

3377
02:39:58,941 --> 02:40:00,242
Are you familiar with the fact

3378
02:40:00,275 --> 02:40:01,443
your husband was making contributions

3379
02:40:01,477 --> 02:40:04,546
to the Spanish Civil War as late as 1942?

3380
02:40:04,580 --> 02:40:06,448
I knew that Robert gave money from time to time.

3381
02:40:06,482 --> 02:40:07,716
Did you know this money was going

3382
02:40:07,750 --> 02:40:09,184
into Communist Party channels?

3383
02:40:09,218 --> 02:40:10,653
Don't you mean "through"?

3384
02:40:10,686 --> 02:40:12,454
-Pardon? -I think you mean

3385
02:40:12,488 --> 02:40:14,289
"through Communist Party channels," don't you?

3386
02:40:14,323 --> 02:40:15,557
-Y-Yes! -Yes?

3387
02:40:15,591 --> 02:40:17,493
-Yes! -KITTY: Yes.

3388
02:40:17,526 --> 02:40:21,230
Then would it be fair to say that this meant that by 1942,

3389
02:40:21,263 --> 02:40:22,564
your husband had not stopped

3390
02:40:22,598 --> 02:40:24,533
having anything to do with the Communist Party?

3391
02:40:24,566 --> 02:40:26,368
You don't have to answer that yes or no.

3392
02:40:26,402 --> 02:40:27,770
You can answer that any way you wish.

3393
02:40:27,803 --> 02:40:29,672
I know that, thank you.

3394
02:40:29,705 --> 02:40:31,407
It's your question.

3395
02:40:31,440 --> 02:40:33,342
-It's not properly phrased. -Do you understand

3396
02:40:33,375 --> 02:40:34,610
-what I'm getting at? -I do.

3397
02:40:34,643 --> 02:40:35,911
Then why don't you answer it that way?

3398
02:40:35,944 --> 02:40:37,546
'Cause I don't like your phrase.

3399
02:40:37,579 --> 02:40:39,515
"Having anything to do with the Communist Party."

3400
02:40:39,548 --> 02:40:41,350
Because Robert never had anything to do

3401
02:40:41,383 --> 02:40:42,685
with the Communist Party as such.

3402
02:40:42,718 --> 02:40:45,354
I know he gave money to Spanish refugees.

3403
02:40:45,387 --> 02:40:47,322
I know he took an intellectual interest

3404
02:40:47,356 --> 02:40:48,557
in Communist ideas...

3405
02:40:48,590 --> 02:40:49,692
Are there two types of Communists?

3406
02:40:49,725 --> 02:40:51,427
Intellectual Communists

3407
02:40:51,460 --> 02:40:53,395
and your plain old regular Commie?

3408
02:40:53,429 --> 02:40:54,363
(laughs)

3409
02:40:54,396 --> 02:40:55,964
Well, I couldn't answer that one.

3410
02:40:55,998 --> 02:40:58,767
(laughs) I couldn't either.

3411
02:41:04,907 --> 02:41:06,709
Evening.

3412
02:41:06,742 --> 02:41:08,477
Robert, you can't win this thing.

3413
02:41:08,510 --> 02:41:10,446
It's a kangaroo court with a predetermined outcome.

3414
02:41:10,479 --> 02:41:12,414
Why put yourself through more of it?

3415
02:41:13,015 --> 02:41:15,451
I have my reasons.

3416
02:41:16,052 --> 02:41:17,486
All right.

3417
02:41:17,519 --> 02:41:18,654
Good night.

3418
02:41:23,358 --> 02:41:24,760
He has a point.

3419
02:41:25,694 --> 02:41:27,730
I'm not sure you understand, Albert.

3420
02:41:27,763 --> 02:41:28,864
No?

3421
02:41:28,897 --> 02:41:32,401
I left my country never to return.

3422
02:41:33,035 --> 02:41:35,003
You served your country well.

3423
02:41:35,037 --> 02:41:38,674
If this is the reward she offers you, then...

3424
02:41:38,707 --> 02:41:42,344
perhaps you should turn your back on her.

3425
02:41:42,377 --> 02:41:45,013
Damn it, I happen to love this country.

3426
02:41:45,047 --> 02:41:47,649
Then tell them to go to hell.

3427
02:41:47,683 --> 02:41:48,584
Interestingly enough,

3428
02:41:48,617 --> 02:41:51,687
this is no longer a confirmation hearing,

3429
02:41:51,720 --> 02:41:53,889
it's now a trial...

3430
02:41:53,922 --> 02:41:55,657
about a trial!

3431
02:41:56,658 --> 02:41:57,960
It's not good he's telling everyone

3432
02:41:57,993 --> 02:41:59,294
you initiated the hearings.

3433
02:41:59,328 --> 02:42:01,697
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

3434
02:42:01,730 --> 02:42:04,399
He certainly can't prove that I gave the file to Borden.

3435
02:42:04,433 --> 02:42:06,769
We're not in court, sir.

3436
02:42:06,802 --> 02:42:08,003
There's no burden of proof.

3437
02:42:08,036 --> 02:42:10,405
Right. They're not convicting...

3438
02:42:10,439 --> 02:42:11,707
(sighs) just denying.

3439
02:42:11,740 --> 02:42:14,643
Why would Hill come here to tear me down?

3440
02:42:14,676 --> 02:42:16,311
What's his angle?

3441
02:42:16,345 --> 02:42:18,447
Do people need a reason to do the right thing?

3442
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:20,083
-As he sees it. -I told you,

3443
02:42:20,116 --> 02:42:22,785
Oppenheimer poisoned the scientists against me,

3444
02:42:22,818 --> 02:42:24,520
right from that first meeting.

3445
02:42:24,553 --> 02:42:27,790
<i>I don't know what Oppenheimer</i> <i>said to him that day,</i>

3446
02:42:27,823 --> 02:42:30,559
but Einstein wouldn't even meet my eye.

3447
02:42:30,592 --> 02:42:31,627
(inaudible)

3448
02:42:31,660 --> 02:42:34,763
<i>Oppenheimer knows</i> <i>how to manipulate his own.</i>

3449
02:42:34,797 --> 02:42:36,065
And at Los Alamos,

3450
02:42:36,099 --> 02:42:38,433
he preyed on the naivete of scientists

3451
02:42:38,467 --> 02:42:40,769
who thought they'd get a say in how we used their work,

3452
02:42:40,803 --> 02:42:43,806
but don't ever think he was that naive himself.

3453
02:42:43,839 --> 02:42:45,108
Doctor.

3454
02:42:45,141 --> 02:42:47,110
During your work on the hydrogen bomb,

3455
02:42:47,143 --> 02:42:50,813
were you deterred by any moral qualms?

3456
02:42:50,846 --> 02:42:52,481
Yes, of course.

3457
02:42:52,514 --> 02:42:53,816
But you still got on with your work, didn't you?

3458
02:42:53,849 --> 02:42:56,085
Yes, because this was work of exploration,

3459
02:42:56,119 --> 02:42:58,353
it was not the preparation of a weapon.

3460
02:42:58,387 --> 02:43:00,455
You mean it was more of a... an academic excursion.

3461
02:43:00,489 --> 02:43:02,391
No, it is not an academic thing

3462
02:43:02,424 --> 02:43:03,826
whether you can build a hydrogen bomb.

3463
02:43:03,859 --> 02:43:05,460
It's a matter of life and death.

3464
02:43:05,494 --> 02:43:06,862
By 1942, you were actively pushing

3465
02:43:06,895 --> 02:43:08,463
the development of the hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

3466
02:43:08,497 --> 02:43:09,731
Pushing's not the right word.

3467
02:43:09,765 --> 02:43:11,700
Supporting it and working on it, yes.

3468
02:43:11,733 --> 02:43:14,070
So when did these moral qualms become so strong

3469
02:43:14,103 --> 02:43:15,737
that you actively opposed

3470
02:43:15,771 --> 02:43:17,439
the development of the hydrogen bomb?

3471
02:43:17,472 --> 02:43:19,441
When it was suggested that it be the policy

3472
02:43:19,474 --> 02:43:21,643
of the United States to make these things at all cost

3473
02:43:21,677 --> 02:43:23,679
without regard to the balance between these weapons

3474
02:43:23,712 --> 02:43:26,782
and atomic weapons as part of our arsenal.

3475
02:43:28,151 --> 02:43:30,086
What do moral qualms have to do with that?

3476
02:43:30,119 --> 02:43:32,155
Wha... What do moral qualms

3477
02:43:32,188 --> 02:43:33,722
-have to do with it? -ROBB: Yes.

3478
02:43:33,755 --> 02:43:35,824
Oppenheimer wanted to own the atomic bomb.

3479
02:43:35,858 --> 02:43:37,759
He wanted to be the man who moved the Earth.

3480
02:43:37,793 --> 02:43:40,963
He talks about putting the nuclear genie

3481
02:43:40,996 --> 02:43:42,464
back in the bottle.

3482
02:43:42,497 --> 02:43:43,632
Well, I'm here to tell you

3483
02:43:43,665 --> 02:43:45,868
that I know J. Robert Oppenheimer,

3484
02:43:45,901 --> 02:43:50,005
and if he could do it all over, he'd do it all the same.

3485
02:43:50,038 --> 02:43:53,076
You know he's never once said that he regrets Hiroshima?

3486
02:43:53,109 --> 02:43:55,978
He'd do it all over. Why?

3487
02:43:56,011 --> 02:43:57,446
Because it made him

3488
02:43:57,479 --> 02:43:59,115
the most important man who ever lived.

3489
02:43:59,148 --> 02:44:01,483
(voice quivering): Well, we've...

3490
02:44:01,516 --> 02:44:03,619
we've freely used the atomic bomb...

3491
02:44:03,652 --> 02:44:05,754
In fact, Doctor, you assisted in selecting

3492
02:44:05,787 --> 02:44:07,190
the target to drop the atomic bomb on Japan,

3493
02:44:07,223 --> 02:44:08,891
-didn't you? -Yes.

3494
02:44:08,924 --> 02:44:10,559
Well, then you knew, did you not, that by dropping

3495
02:44:10,592 --> 02:44:12,761
that atomic bomb on the target you selected,

3496
02:44:12,794 --> 02:44:14,197
that thousands of civilians would be killed

3497
02:44:14,230 --> 02:44:15,964
or injured, is that correct?

3498
02:44:15,998 --> 02:44:17,900
Yes, not as many as turned out...

3499
02:44:17,933 --> 02:44:20,136
Oh. Well, how many were killed or injured?

3500
02:44:20,169 --> 02:44:22,037
-70,000. -ROBB: 70,000

3501
02:44:22,071 --> 02:44:23,139
at both Hiroshima and...

3502
02:44:23,172 --> 02:44:24,606
110,000 at both.

3503
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:26,041
On the day of each bombing?

3504
02:44:26,075 --> 02:44:27,976
(tense music playing)

3505
02:44:28,010 --> 02:44:29,178
Yes.

3506
02:44:29,212 --> 02:44:30,779
And in the weeks and years that followed?

3507
02:44:30,812 --> 02:44:33,515
It has been put at somewhere between 50 and 100,000.

3508
02:44:33,548 --> 02:44:35,651
-220,000 dead at least? -ROBERT: Yes.

3509
02:44:35,684 --> 02:44:37,586
Any moral scruples about that?

3510
02:44:38,954 --> 02:44:40,056
Terrible ones.

3511
02:44:40,089 --> 02:44:41,657
But yet you testified in here

3512
02:44:41,690 --> 02:44:44,060
that the bombing of Hiroshima was very successful.

3513
02:44:44,093 --> 02:44:45,661
-Technically successful. -ROBB: Oh!

3514
02:44:45,694 --> 02:44:47,462
Technically, it was very successful.

3515
02:44:47,496 --> 02:44:48,964
And it is also alleged to have helped end the war.

3516
02:44:48,997 --> 02:44:50,966
Would you have been in support of the dropping

3517
02:44:50,999 --> 02:44:52,935
of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

3518
02:44:52,968 --> 02:44:54,503
That would make no sense at all.

3519
02:44:54,536 --> 02:44:56,972
-Why? -The-the target is too small.

3520
02:44:57,005 --> 02:44:59,508
Well, supposing there had been a target in Japan

3521
02:44:59,541 --> 02:45:01,009
big enough for a thermonuclear weapon,

3522
02:45:01,043 --> 02:45:02,811
would you have been opposed to the dropping of it?

3523
02:45:02,844 --> 02:45:04,680
This was not a problem with which I was confronted...

3524
02:45:04,713 --> 02:45:06,149
Well, I'm confronting you with it now, sir.

3525
02:45:06,182 --> 02:45:07,950
It was all part of his plan.

3526
02:45:07,983 --> 02:45:09,551
He wanted the glorious,

3527
02:45:09,584 --> 02:45:11,753
insincere guilt of the self-important

3528
02:45:11,787 --> 02:45:13,256
to wear like a fuckin' crown.

3529
02:45:13,289 --> 02:45:16,725
Say, "No, we cannot go down this road,"

3530
02:45:16,758 --> 02:45:19,561
even as he knew we'd have to.

3531
02:45:19,594 --> 02:45:21,130
Would you have been opposed to the dropping

3532
02:45:21,164 --> 02:45:22,831
of a thermonuclear weapon on Japan

3533
02:45:22,864 --> 02:45:25,101
-because of moral scruples? -Yes, I believe I would, sir.

3534
02:45:25,134 --> 02:45:26,835
Well, did you oppose the dropping

3535
02:45:26,868 --> 02:45:28,870
of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima because of moral scruples?

3536
02:45:28,904 --> 02:45:30,539
-We set forth our arguments... -(tense music building)

3537
02:45:30,572 --> 02:45:31,974
No, you, you, you. I'm asking you.

3538
02:45:32,007 --> 02:45:33,642
-I set... I set forth... -ROBB: Not we. You, you, you!

3539
02:45:33,675 --> 02:45:35,278
...our arguments against dropping it,

3540
02:45:35,311 --> 02:45:36,845
but I did not endorse them.

3541
02:45:36,878 --> 02:45:38,580
You mean after working night and day

3542
02:45:38,613 --> 02:45:39,982
for three years building the bomb,

3543
02:45:40,015 --> 02:45:41,850
you then argued against the use of it? (laughs)

3544
02:45:41,883 --> 02:45:44,586
I was asked by the Secretary of War

3545
02:45:44,619 --> 02:45:45,988
what the views of scientists were.

3546
02:45:46,021 --> 02:45:48,757
I gave him the views against and the views for.

3547
02:45:48,790 --> 02:45:50,792
You supported the dropping of the atom bomb on Japan.

3548
02:45:50,826 --> 02:45:52,295
-What do you mean "support"? -ROBB: Didn't you?

3549
02:45:52,328 --> 02:45:53,795
-You supported it! -What do you mean "support"?

3550
02:45:53,829 --> 02:45:55,164
Well, you helped pick the target, didn't you?

3551
02:45:55,198 --> 02:45:56,832
-(muffled rumbling) -I did my job.

3552
02:45:56,865 --> 02:45:58,600
I was not in a policy-making position at Los Alamos.

3553
02:45:58,633 --> 02:46:00,269
I would have done anything I was asked to do.

3554
02:46:00,303 --> 02:46:02,571
Well, then you would have built the H-bomb too,

3555
02:46:02,604 --> 02:46:03,739
-wouldn't you? -I couldn't.

3556
02:46:03,772 --> 02:46:05,674
I didn't ask you that, Doctor!

3557
02:46:05,707 --> 02:46:08,043
And the GAC report which you co-authored

3558
02:46:08,077 --> 02:46:09,945
after the Soviet atomic test said

3559
02:46:09,978 --> 02:46:12,647
a Super bomb should never be built!

3560
02:46:12,681 --> 02:46:14,016
What we meant, what I meant was...

3561
02:46:14,049 --> 02:46:16,119
-ROBB: What you, who? Who? -What I meant...

3562
02:46:16,152 --> 02:46:17,853
(tense music continues)

3563
02:46:17,886 --> 02:46:19,322
And wouldn't the Russians do anything

3564
02:46:19,355 --> 02:46:21,623
-to increase their strength? -(music stops)

3565
02:46:21,656 --> 02:46:23,625
(raises voice): If we did it, they would have to do it.

3566
02:46:23,658 --> 02:46:25,694
Our efforts would only fuel their efforts,

3567
02:46:25,727 --> 02:46:27,829
just as it had with the atomic bomb.

3568
02:46:27,863 --> 02:46:31,267
"Just as it had with the atomic bomb," exactly!

3569
02:46:31,300 --> 02:46:36,038
No moral scruples in 1945, plenty in 1949.

3570
02:46:40,176 --> 02:46:42,010
Dr. Oppenheimer...

3571
02:46:43,678 --> 02:46:46,282
...when did your strong moral convictions develop

3572
02:46:46,315 --> 02:46:49,118
with respect to the hydrogen bomb?

3573
02:46:56,159 --> 02:46:59,062
When it became clear to me

3574
02:46:59,095 --> 02:47:02,731
that we would tend to use any weapon we had.

3575
02:47:05,168 --> 02:47:07,669
<i>J. Robert Oppenheimer,</i> <i>the martyr.</i>

3576
02:47:07,702 --> 02:47:10,306
I gave him exactly what he wanted.

3577
02:47:10,339 --> 02:47:12,607
To be remembered for Trinity,

3578
02:47:12,641 --> 02:47:15,244
not Hiroshima,

3579
02:47:15,278 --> 02:47:17,712
not Nagasaki.

3580
02:47:20,249 --> 02:47:22,951
He should be thanking me.

3581
02:47:22,984 --> 02:47:25,921
Well, he's not.

3582
02:47:25,954 --> 02:47:27,722
(huffs)

3583
02:47:27,756 --> 02:47:29,358
Do we still have enough votes,

3584
02:47:29,392 --> 02:47:31,060
or is the crowning moment of my career

3585
02:47:31,094 --> 02:47:35,231
about to become the most public humiliation of my life?

3586
02:47:35,264 --> 02:47:37,833
Full Senate's about to vote.

3587
02:47:37,866 --> 02:47:39,034
You'll scrape through.

3588
02:47:39,068 --> 02:47:40,702
Great, then gather the fucking press.

3589
02:47:40,735 --> 02:47:42,704
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

3590
02:47:42,737 --> 02:47:45,707
This board, having heard testimony from you

3591
02:47:45,740 --> 02:47:48,877
and many of your current and former colleagues,

3592
02:47:48,910 --> 02:47:50,912
has come to the unanimous conclusion

3593
02:47:50,946 --> 02:47:54,049
that you are a loyal citizen.

3594
02:47:55,351 --> 02:47:56,985
However,

3595
02:47:57,018 --> 02:48:00,655
in the light of your continuing associations

3596
02:48:00,689 --> 02:48:01,957
and disregard

3597
02:48:01,990 --> 02:48:04,127
for the security apparatus of this country,

3598
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:07,696
together with your somewhat disturbing conduct

3599
02:48:07,729 --> 02:48:10,266
on the hydrogen bomb program

3600
02:48:10,299 --> 02:48:11,833
and the regrettable lack of candor

3601
02:48:11,867 --> 02:48:14,237
in certain of your responses to this board,

3602
02:48:14,270 --> 02:48:17,140
we have voted two to one

3603
02:48:17,173 --> 02:48:20,276
to deny the renewal of your security clearance.

3604
02:48:20,309 --> 02:48:23,412
A full written opinion, with a dissent from Mr. Evans,

3605
02:48:23,446 --> 02:48:26,948
will be issued to the AEC in the coming days.

3606
02:48:26,982 --> 02:48:28,650
That is all.

3607
02:48:32,421 --> 02:48:33,755
-ROBB: Gordon... -GORDON: Roger.

3608
02:48:33,788 --> 02:48:35,657
(indistinct exchange)

3609
02:48:38,793 --> 02:48:40,695
<i>Robert.</i>

3610
02:48:41,330 --> 02:48:42,864
(on phone): Robert.

3611
02:48:45,334 --> 02:48:46,835
Don't...

3612
02:48:49,205 --> 02:48:52,408
Don't take in the sheets. (breathes heavily)

3613
02:48:52,441 --> 02:48:53,775
(clamoring)

3614
02:48:53,808 --> 02:48:55,211
Get a picture with him.

3615
02:48:55,244 --> 02:48:56,479
Sir, sir.

3616
02:48:56,512 --> 02:48:58,980
SENATE AIDE: Two minutes. Two minutes.

3617
02:48:59,014 --> 02:49:00,216
-You'll get your shot. -REPORTER 1: Please, sir.

3618
02:49:00,249 --> 02:49:01,816
We've been waiting for so long.

3619
02:49:01,850 --> 02:49:02,851
-REPORTER 2: Evening, sir. -REPORTER 3: Come out.

3620
02:49:02,884 --> 02:49:03,919
REPORTER 4: Sir, sir!

3621
02:49:03,952 --> 02:49:05,288
Is it official?

3622
02:49:07,390 --> 02:49:08,790
SENATE AIDE: Well, there were,

3623
02:49:08,823 --> 02:49:11,960
uh, a couple of unexpected holdouts.

3624
02:49:11,993 --> 02:49:14,130
(solemn music playing)

3625
02:49:16,399 --> 02:49:19,068
I'm denied. Yeah?

3626
02:49:19,101 --> 02:49:21,070
-I'm afraid so, sir. -All right.

3627
02:49:28,777 --> 02:49:29,844
Who were the holdouts?

3628
02:49:29,878 --> 02:49:32,814
Um, there were three,

3629
02:49:32,847 --> 02:49:35,784
led by the junior senator from Massachusetts.

3630
02:49:35,817 --> 02:49:37,220
Young guy trying to make a name for himself,

3631
02:49:37,253 --> 02:49:39,821
didn't like what you did to Oppenheimer.

3632
02:49:39,854 --> 02:49:40,989
What's his name?

3633
02:49:41,022 --> 02:49:43,226
Uh, Kennedy.

3634
02:49:43,259 --> 02:49:45,061
John F. Kennedy.

3635
02:49:48,531 --> 02:49:49,931
Kitty?

3636
02:49:56,004 --> 02:49:59,408
Did you think that if you let them tar and feather you,

3637
02:49:59,442 --> 02:50:02,010
that the world would forgive you?

3638
02:50:05,548 --> 02:50:06,982
It won't.

3639
02:50:09,352 --> 02:50:10,752
We'll see.

3640
02:50:20,529 --> 02:50:22,531
Goddamn it.

3641
02:50:22,565 --> 02:50:24,032
(sighs)

3642
02:50:24,066 --> 02:50:27,002
(chuckles wryly) You told me I'd be okay.

3643
02:50:27,035 --> 02:50:29,405
Yeah, well, I didn't have all the facts, did I?

3644
02:50:29,438 --> 02:50:31,006
Here's a fact.

3645
02:50:31,039 --> 02:50:32,874
President Eisenhower pinned the Medal of Freedom

3646
02:50:32,907 --> 02:50:34,343
on my chest last year

3647
02:50:34,377 --> 02:50:36,878
'cause I've always done what's right for this country.

3648
02:50:36,911 --> 02:50:39,415
They don't want me in the Cabinet room?

3649
02:50:39,448 --> 02:50:41,883
Well, that's... that's fine.

3650
02:50:41,916 --> 02:50:44,253
Maybe they should just invite Oppenheimer instead.

3651
02:50:44,287 --> 02:50:45,321
Maybe they will.

3652
02:50:46,322 --> 02:50:47,556
I told you,

3653
02:50:47,590 --> 02:50:50,226
he turned the scientists against me one by one,

3654
02:50:50,259 --> 02:50:52,428
starting with Einstein. I told you about, uh, Einstein.

3655
02:50:52,461 --> 02:50:53,895
I saw him by the pond.

3656
02:50:53,928 --> 02:50:55,431
You did, but you know, sir,

3657
02:50:55,464 --> 02:50:57,466
since nobody really knows

3658
02:50:57,500 --> 02:50:59,135
what they said to each other that day,

3659
02:50:59,168 --> 02:51:03,205
is it possible they didn't talk about you at all?

3660
02:51:03,239 --> 02:51:06,375
Is it possible they spoke about something, uh,

3661
02:51:06,409 --> 02:51:07,842
more important?

3662
02:51:07,876 --> 02:51:09,312
Mr. Strauss!

3663
02:51:09,345 --> 02:51:11,046
(clamoring)

3664
02:51:12,648 --> 02:51:15,050
Over here! Mr. Strauss!

3665
02:51:18,187 --> 02:51:21,457
Oh. (chuckling)

3666
02:51:21,490 --> 02:51:22,591
(gentle music playing)

3667
02:51:22,625 --> 02:51:23,925
Thank you.

3668
02:51:23,958 --> 02:51:26,462
-(laughing) -Albert.

3669
02:51:26,495 --> 02:51:28,464
-Ah. -(clears throat)

3670
02:51:28,497 --> 02:51:30,999
The man of the moment.

3671
02:51:34,103 --> 02:51:37,473
You once held a-a reception for me.

3672
02:51:37,506 --> 02:51:39,308
In Berkeley. You gave me an award.

3673
02:51:39,342 --> 02:51:41,210
-Hmm? -Yes.

3674
02:51:42,111 --> 02:51:44,513
You all thought that I had lost the ability

3675
02:51:44,547 --> 02:51:47,483
to understand what I'd started.

3676
02:51:47,516 --> 02:51:50,952
So the award really wasn't for me,

3677
02:51:50,985 --> 02:51:53,389
it was for all of you, hmm?

3678
02:51:55,257 --> 02:51:57,259
Now it's your turn

3679
02:51:57,293 --> 02:52:01,996
to deal with the consequences of your achievement.

3680
02:52:02,931 --> 02:52:04,233
And one day,

3681
02:52:04,266 --> 02:52:06,901
when they've punished you enough...

3682
02:52:08,304 --> 02:52:12,208
...they'll serve you salmon and potato salad.

3683
02:52:15,944 --> 02:52:17,979
Make speeches...

3684
02:52:19,013 --> 02:52:20,516
<i>...give you a medal.</i>

3685
02:52:20,549 --> 02:52:22,184
(applause)

3686
02:52:22,218 --> 02:52:24,387
Hello, Frank.

3687
02:52:24,420 --> 02:52:25,654
You're happy, I'm happy.

3688
02:52:25,688 --> 02:52:28,190
(gentle music continues)

3689

<i>Pat you on the back,</i> <i>tell you all is forgiven.</i>

3690
02:52:37,500 --> 02:52:39,901
<i>Just remember...</i>

3691
02:52:40,536 --> 02:52:42,405
<i>...it won't be for you.</i>

3692
02:52:46,675 --> 02:52:48,310
<i>It'll be for them.</i>

3693

(suspenseful music playing)

3694
02:53:02,458 --> 02:53:03,992
Albert.

3695
02:53:05,227 --> 02:53:08,697
When I came to you with those calculations,

3696
02:53:08,731 --> 02:53:10,965
we thought we might start a chain reaction

3697
02:53:10,999 --> 02:53:14,470
that would destroy the entire world.

3698
02:53:14,503 --> 02:53:17,972
Mm, I remember it well.

3699
02:53:18,006 --> 02:53:20,075
What of it?

3700
02:53:22,711 --> 02:53:24,447
I believe we did.

3701
02:53:24,480 --> 02:53:26,749
