1
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:14,379
Before I start signing these,

2
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:17,090
I need to thank somebody
who's here tonight.

3
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:20,260
When I had her at State--
That didn't sound right.

4
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:23,638
I never had her.
I wanted her, but never had her.

5
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:26,057
What I meant was
when I took her class.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,603
I had the worst case
of writer's block in the world.

7
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:33,398
All I had were terrible ideas.
I hated them all.

8
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:35,400
I was just about
to drop the class

9
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:41,323
when she said something to me
that changed everything.

10
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:48,329
She said, "Terrible ideas
are like playground scapegoats.

11
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:51,540
Given the right encouragement,
they grow up to be geniuses."

12
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:55,504
She told me to take one,
and work on it.

13
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:58,173
Well, I did.

14
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:03,220
Frances Mayes,
who loves terrible ideas,

15
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:05,514
may I please French kiss
you now?

16
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:06,890
Go for it, Willie boy!

17
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:09,393
Married, William.
Sorry.

18
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:14,146
Proud of me?

19
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,024
Ridiculously.

20
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:18,318
Frances, these are amazing.
What did you do?

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,487
Chocolate is timing, my friend.

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,864
- The rest is magic.
- Hey, Professor.

23
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:25,909
- Where is the wine?
- Over there.

24
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,661
Tom is one lucky bastard.

25
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:30,122
A literary wife
who makes brownies.

26
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:31,915
I swear, if you tell me
you cook in the nude,

27
00:01:31,998 --> 00:01:33,834
I'll go home and kill myself.

28
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,960
Never in the nude.
Always in a thong.

29
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:40,048
Actually, if you knew Frances,
you'd know these are avoidance.

30
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:41,299
Thanks.

31
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:43,468
- How's the novel going?
- Not so well.

32
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:47,222
But the procrastination
is coming along fabulously.

33
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:49,725
Soon it will breed
abject self-loathing,

34
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:52,644
and then I'll just become
a writing machine.

35
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:55,897
What about Tom?
How's his book going?

36
00:01:56,022 --> 00:01:58,149
Fine.
He's home writing right now.

37
00:01:58,232 --> 00:01:59,191
You know Tom?

38
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:02,571
I met him recently,
sort of by coincidence.

39
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:07,159
The other coincidence is that
you reviewed a book of mine.

40
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:10,120
I did?
Did I like it?

41
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:12,289
You didn't.

42
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:15,333
Well, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:18,670
I'm sure there were a lot
of other critics who loved it.

44
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:21,839
And I really hope
you didn't take it personally.

45
00:02:21,922 --> 00:02:25,886
You called my lead character
"unrealistic."

46
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:29,890
I think bad reviews
should just be forgotten.

47
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:31,558
Give him a brownie.

48
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:34,394
I would like to give you this.
It comes in peace.

49
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:37,981
You said you just couldn't
get interested in a novel

50
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:40,275
where the protagonist was a guy

51
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:44,695
who spent all of his time living
out his horny teenage fantasies.

52
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:48,741
I just find that ironic.

53
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:51,703
Ironic. Why?

54
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,374
Ask your husband.

55
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,260
What did he just say?

56
00:03:28,115 --> 00:03:29,574
Frances?

57
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:31,158
Frances?

58
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:36,248
I've got some
unfortunate news for you.

59
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,128
I just got off the phone
with your husband's attorney,

60
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:44,840
and they're going to
pursue alimony.

61
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:48,885
How can we be talking
about alimony

62
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:52,347
when I hardly make enough money?

63
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:55,224
But you supported him
during the marriage.

64
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:56,434
Yes.

65
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:59,312
But while he was researching
and writing his book,

66
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:01,648
I worked while
he pretended to be...

67
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:04,693
Unfortunately,
this is just about the math.

68
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:06,194
He was having an affair.

69
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:08,572
California's a no-fault state.

70
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:10,365
His attorney indicated
your husband

71
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,659
would prefer an alimony buy-out.

72
00:04:12,743 --> 00:04:15,954
Since you two were living
rather modestly,

73
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:18,622
I don't think
the number should be too bad.

74
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:24,838
They're probably talking about
something like $200,000.

75
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,423
I don't have that money.

76
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:28,759
Unfortunately, you do.

77
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:31,094
The house?

78
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:35,098
Its value went through the roof
since you bought it.

79
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,727
And renovated it
with my mother's money.

80
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,064
Well, it's all
community property now.

81
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:50,155
So he gets
half the house and alimony.

82
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:53,658
There's leeway, and we'll make
all the arguments we can.

83
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:57,287
But there is a bargaining chip.
He wants the house.

84
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:00,665
- He wants to keep living there?
- Yeah.

85
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:02,876
And if you let him have it,

86
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:07,088
you could end up with
a lot of money in your pocket.

87
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:09,800
I understand he wants it
pretty badly.

88
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:13,553
I'm sorry.
This is so surreal.

89
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:19,976
How would he even find the money
to buy me out of my half?

90
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:23,939
Oh.

91
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:26,358
Oh.

92
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:28,984
Wow.

93
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:31,695
Apparently, she likes the place.

94
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:34,074
It's near the right schools.

95
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,412
Schools?

96
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:39,830
She's...

97
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:50,423
You're gonna get over this.

98
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:52,967
You will, Frances.

99
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:56,805
Someday,
you're gonna be happy again.

100
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,268
Right.

101
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:02,728
And the desk?

102
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:04,604
The desk goes.

103
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:08,066
No, the desk can stay.

104
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,277
- The couch?
- Yes, please.

105
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,453
Wait a minute.
No, the sofas can stay.

106
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,459
How about the chairs?

107
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,002
They stay, too.

108
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:33,300
Actually, everything's going
to stay except those boxes.

109
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:35,510
Those boxes
with the books in them.

110
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:39,555
If you don't mind.

111
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:41,432
You're sure?

112
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:42,684
Yeah.

113
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:44,644
The bedroom?

114
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,064
Nope.

115
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:50,275
- Kitchen?
- No.

116
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:57,991
So then we're done.

117
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:00,326
We're done.

118
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:24,642
You getting a divorce?

119
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,562
It shows?

120
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,565
These are furnished,
short-term apartments.

121
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,068
That's who we get.

122
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:36,154
Your neighbor in 2-B.
He's an attorney.

123
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:39,199
His divorce has been
dragging on for three years.

124
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:41,159
Nice guy.

125
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,495
Gives free legal advice
to the other tenants.

126
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:49,750
If his crying gets on your
nerves, just bang on the wall.

127
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,420
- He'll stop.
- Sorry.

128
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:58,093
Guy above you is a doctor.
He hands out the sleeping pills.

129
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:00,429
- What do you do?
- I'm a writer.

130
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:04,808
So you can help the others
with their suicide notes.

131
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:05,726
Wow.

132
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:08,520
You're one of those
funny landlords.

133
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:10,396
Not really.

134
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:13,733
Well, here's your keys.

135
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:17,404
Have a good stay.

136
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,322
Thanks.

137
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:33,753
Home.

138
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:43,597
Ta-da!

139
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:46,058
You start a marriage
with cake and champagne.

140
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:47,476
Finish it that way, too.

141
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,063
The beginning and the end
should be fun, fun, fun.

142
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:53,148
Too bad about those years
in the middle.

143
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,358
- Sorry.
- Make a wish.

144
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,068
Things got crazy
at the hospital.

145
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,862
Hi. You made it
in time for the toast.

146
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:02,323
Bravo.
And it only took a year.

147
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:04,493
- To freedom.
- To freedom.

148
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:05,786
Thanks.

149
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,668
You're not drinking.
You're not drinking.

150
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,045
Fifth time was a charm.

151
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,339
Oh, my God!

152
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:19,841
Patti!
When are you due?

153
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:21,634
- May.
- May!

154
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:23,052
Oh, my God!

155
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:24,762
I'm going to be an auntie!

156
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:28,392
I'm going to be an auntie.
Yes.

157
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,646
It changes our plans a bit.

158
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:34,147
Well, of course.

159
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:37,526
We were about to take a 10-day
tour to romantic Tuscany.

160
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,487
But I don't want Patti flying.

161
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,364
Small sacrifice.

162
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:45,866
We decided to change
our coach tickets

163
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:49,871
into an upgraded ticket for you.

164
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,710
Oh.

165
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:57,003
This is amazing.

166
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:58,255
Really generous.

167
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:02,259
Thank you, but no.

168
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:04,761
How can you say no to Tuscany?

169
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:06,637
No.
Like that.

170
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,848
That's your depression speaking.

171
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:12,184
It doesn't speak Italian.
It speaks high-school French.

172
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,729
Besides,
I'm not depressed anymore.

173
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,065
Then what are you still doing
living with those losers?

174
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,193
- Those are my people.
- That's not a place you live.

175
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,903
Guys, come on.

176
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:24,573
Thank you so much.

177
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:28,910
But there is no way I can go
on a romantic tour of Tuscany.

178
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:31,078
- I'm not ready to meet anyone.
- You won't.

179
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,664
- We can assure you.
- Oh?

180
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:37,878
It's a gay tour
of romantic Tuscany.

181
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,255
So it would be
very relaxing for you.

182
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,049
You know, mostly couples.

183
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,885
No one would be there
to hit on you.

184
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:48,597
And you could concentrate and
listen to your own inner voice.

185
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:50,599
My inner voice?

186
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:53,601
My inner voice
that would be saying,

187
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:55,895
"What am I doing
on a gay tour of Tuscany?"

188
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:59,065
Frances, it's Italy!
Italy.

189
00:10:59,148 --> 00:11:02,652
Plus, you could use it
as a time to start writing.

190
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:06,490
Well, I'm busy. I have to
review all those books.

191
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:09,242
Instead of working
on your own book.

192
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,786
Wow.

193
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,538
Are you being mean
or just hormonal?

194
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,335
Okay. Don't kill each other
until I get back.

195
00:11:22,963 --> 00:11:25,467
Can we please just talk
about the baby?

196
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,344
I think you're in danger.

197
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,012
Of?

198
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:32,099
Of never recovering.

199
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:36,353
You know when you come across
one of those empty-shell people?

200
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:40,022
And you think,
"What the hell happened to you?"

201
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:43,401
Well, there came a time
in each one of those lives

202
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:45,319
where they were at a crossroads.

203
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,240
Crossroads.
God, that is so "Oprah."

204
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:52,244
Someplace where they had to
decide to turn left or right.

205
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:54,996
This is no time to be
a chickenshit, Frances.

206
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:56,832
I'm not being a chickenshit.

207
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:58,291
I'm not.

208
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,836
Okay, promise me
you'll think about it.

209
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:02,754
I'll think about it.

210
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:04,130
Okay.

211
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,383
I got a feeling about you.

212
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:10,345
- Are you looking for a place?
- Yeah, I guess.

213
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:12,639
- You getting a divorce?
- What?

214
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:14,391
We got short-term apartments.

215
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:16,435
But don't worry.
Some stay for years.

216
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:19,104
We got a writer.
We got a doctor.

217
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:21,732
The doctor could help you
straighten out your life.

218
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:32,825
Hey!

219
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:33,994
Sorry.

220
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:36,580
It's okay.

221
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:40,042
- Do you want to come over?
- No!

222
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:45,255
Maybe later.

223
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:53,846
Maybe later.
Oh!

224
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:12,115
Hello?

225
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:15,076
Patti, when do I leave?

226
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:25,462
Hi, I'm David.
This is your driver, Eduardo.

227
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:28,465
And you are "Gay & Away"!

228
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:35,764
And welcome to your first day
of a romantic tour of Tuscany.

229
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,475
Now, I saw most of you getting
to know each other on the plane.

230
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,436
But I wanted to make sure
you've all met Frances.

231
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,231
Hey, Frances.

232
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:46,733
- Now, Frances is straight.
- Oh, poor girl.

233
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:49,069
And she just survived
a terrible divorce.

234
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:52,406
And according to her friend
Patti, she needs our support.

235
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:58,412
So, Frances, why don't you stand
up, and let everyone say hello?

236
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:01,580
No.
Come on.

237
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:02,581
Hi!

238
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:05,626
You're the bachelor, Frances.
Have some fun!

239
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:12,259
Okay, everyone,
follow the flower.

240
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,303
Good God, I cannot believe
it is raining.

241
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:19,349
Okay, everyone, we're here!
Yeah! Okay!

242
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:21,351
Oops.
Sorry.

243
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:34,156
You're empty.
You need a little more?

244
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,074
Whoo!
You want more wine?

245
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:38,910
<i>- Little more vino?
- Excuse me.</i>

246
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:42,247
- Can a black gal get a drink?
- Yes, she can.

247
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,791
Frances, little more?

248
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,751
Mm-hmm.

249
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,878
You've got to loosen up, honey.
We having a party!

250
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:34,715
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

251
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,970
<i>Si.</i>

252
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,860
What?

253
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:37,821
Pretty awesome, isn't it?

254
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,825
Yes, I think you could say that.

255
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:44,410
Pretty awesome.

256
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:47,455
God, how am I gonna get
through all of these?

257
00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:50,542
I mean, how do you begin
to describe all of this?

258
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:53,962
If you have a pen,
I could write it for you.

259
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:56,048
Are you a good writer?

260
00:16:57,632 --> 00:17:00,052
I used to be.

261
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:01,011
All right.

262
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:03,680
Well, have a go.

263
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:06,307
To my mom.

264
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,933
Dear Mom.

265
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:13,064
<i>Dear Mom.</i>

266
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:15,525
<i>It's market day in Cortona.</i>

267
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:20,614
<i>The piazza is an ongoing party,
and everyone is invited.</i>

268
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:24,534
<i>Clichés converge
at this navel of the world.</i>

269
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:27,788
<i>You almost want to laugh,
but you can't help feeling</i>

270
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,832
<i>these Italians know more
about having fun than we do.</i>

271
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,709
<i>I eat a hot grape
from the market,</i>

272
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:36,504
<i>and the violet sweetness
breaks open in my mouth.</i>

273
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:39,132
<i>It even smells purple.</i>

274
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:42,928
<i>I wish I could stay longer, but
the bell reminds me of time.</i>

275
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:48,350
<i>"Ding-dang-dong," the bell
says, instead of "ding-dong."</i>

276
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:51,228
<i>- I wish you were here.
- Love...</i>

277
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:53,938
Rodney.

278
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:57,483
Thanks.

279
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,825
"It even smells like purple"?

280
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,868
My mom will never believe
I wrote this.

281
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,789
Keep it.
"Ding-dang-dong goes the bell."

282
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,667
I'm sorry.

283
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,354
Bramasole.

284
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:35,939
"Bramasole."

285
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:45,614
It's a nice little villa.
Rather run-down, but redeemable.

286
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:47,492
Are you going to buy it?

287
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:48,702
No, no, no.

288
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:51,788
I'm just a tourist
here for the day.

289
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:53,707
So?

290
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,752
Well, who wouldn't want to buy
a villa in Tuscany?

291
00:18:56,793 --> 00:19:03,924
But the way my life's been going
that would be a terrible idea.

292
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:05,342
A terrible idea.

293
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:07,720
Mm-hmm.

294
00:19:07,803 --> 00:19:10,097
Don't you just love those?

295
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:40,295
Sorry, everybody.
Unscheduled stop.

296
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:44,132
Look at the sheep.
Oh, my gosh.

297
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,119
Stop the bus!

298
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:15,579
Stop the bus!

299
00:20:53,994 --> 00:20:55,537
Hello?

300
00:20:57,914 --> 00:20:59,540
Hello?

301
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:05,129
Shit.

302
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:27,818
Oh, excuse me.

303
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:29,904
Oh, I'm sorry.

304
00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:31,239
<i>Can I help you, signora?</i>

305
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,368
Yes, I thought
the house was for sale.

306
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,204
Oh, no.
The house is for sale.

307
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:40,415
But, unfortunately,
someone's already buying it.

308
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,044
We like it very much,
and we'll buy it today.

309
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:47,296
Very good.
One moment please.

310
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,839
Excuse me.

311
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:53,844
They want it.
They agree on the price.

312
00:21:53,928 --> 00:21:57,599
So soon?
Then we asked too little.

313
00:21:57,724 --> 00:22:00,018
Ask for 20 million lire more,
at least.

314
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,231
I'm sorry.

315
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm sorry.

316
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:08,692
I'm afraid that there has
been a change in the price.

317
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:12,279
It is now 20 million lire
more expensive.

318
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:15,157
Why? It didn't get
more valuable in five minutes.

319
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:17,661
The contessa feels
she has asked too little

320
00:22:17,744 --> 00:22:18,995
since you agreed to buy it.

321
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,956
That logic is absurd.

322
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,041
Excuse me?

323
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,336
What is the price?

324
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,296
Are you bidding against us?

325
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,216
Wait.
We accept the new price.

326
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,676
No, this is a beautiful house.

327
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:36,971
And whoever wants it
has to pay double.

328
00:22:37,096 --> 00:22:40,141
The contessa says that

329
00:22:40,224 --> 00:22:43,186
since there is so much
interest in the house,

330
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,480
the price is now double.

331
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,107
Since the last 10 seconds?

332
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,567
<i>Normale.</i>

333
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,530
You greedy Americans.
You think you're so entitled.

334
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:55,448
You ruin everything.

335
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:57,658
A lot of us feel
really badly about that.

336
00:22:57,742 --> 00:23:01,245
We're going.
We'll look in Provence.

337
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:02,246
Fascists!

338
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:06,960
And her?
How much will she pay?

339
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:09,463
We'll see.

340
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,631
Is it really double the price?

341
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,554
I can't pay double the price.

342
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:21,849
But please tell the contessa

343
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:28,315
that this is what I got for
my house recently in dollars.

344
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,487
Minus the work on the place.

345
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:37,908
Hammers, buckets.

346
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:41,370
Men.

347
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:43,079
Chocolate.

348
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:47,792
And a rental car
to drive off a cliff

349
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:51,087
when this all turns out
to have been a terrible mistake.

350
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:53,215
That's what I can pay.

351
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:56,134
<i>Signora.</i>

352
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:57,969
You've not even seen the house.

353
00:23:58,053 --> 00:23:59,471
Oh.

354
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:02,641
Well.

355
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:06,977
Well, I...

356
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:12,733
I can't go back
to San Francisco.

357
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,946
No.

358
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:16,988
No.

359
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:18,532
<i>I'm sorry, signora.</i>

360
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:21,201
The contessa's family lived here
for generations,

361
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:26,665
so understandably it is
very difficult for her to sell.

362
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:29,041
Money is not the only issue.
She needs--

363
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,754
A sign.

364
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:37,007
I understand.
I believe in signs, too.

365
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:41,430
Well, thank you.
Thank you.

366
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:48,979
Oh!

367
00:24:49,062 --> 00:24:50,897
- Oh.
- Oh.

368
00:24:50,981 --> 00:24:51,981
Please.

369
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:58,654
What did she say?

370
00:24:58,738 --> 00:25:01,908
In Italy, what happened to you
is a very good sign.

371
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,326
- It is?
- Yes.

372
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,246
And now... would you
like to see the house?

373
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:09,416
First, we open an account.
Then you transfer the money.

374
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:12,502
Here is the legal description.
"Two oxen, two days."

375
00:25:12,586 --> 00:25:14,254
- I'm sorry.
- It's old-fashioned.

376
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:17,882
The land is measured by
how long it would take two oxen

377
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:18,924
to plow it.

378
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,553
Oh.
Oh, that makes sense.

379
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,479
Just like that?

380
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,148
Before the money's
been transferred?

381
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,941
It's a house, not a Vespa.

382
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:37,486
What are you going to do,
steal it?

383
00:25:37,527 --> 00:25:41,280
<i>Besides, Signor Martini
likes you.</i>

384
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,340
Okay. We'll take care
of the rest later.

385
00:25:58,465 --> 00:25:59,091
<i>Normale.</i>

386
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:00,467
<i>Normale?</i>

387
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,218
<i>Normale.</i>

388
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:02,718
<i>Normale.</i>

389
00:26:05,513 --> 00:26:08,724
<i>I have bought a house
in a foreign country.</i>

390
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:12,771
<i>A house and the land it takes
two o xen two days to plow.</i>

391
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:14,231
<i>Not having a plow or an o x,</i>

392
00:26:14,314 --> 00:26:16,525
<i>I'll have to take their word
on that.</i>

393
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,319
<i>Buyer's remorse is
a very common affliction</i>

394
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,695
<i>among new homeowners.</i>

395
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,408
<i>Just because you have
a sudden urge to weep,</i>

396
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,992
<i>that doesn't mean
you've made a mistake.</i>

397
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:30,162
<i>Everybody knows old houses
have their quirks.</i>

398
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:34,333
<i>Especially 300-year-old houses.</i>

399
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:43,009
<i>I have inherited 10, 000
empty wine bottles, one grape,</i>

400
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:46,805
<i>every issue of "La Nazione"
printed in 1958,</i>

401
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:49,932
<i>and assorted previous tenants.</i>

402
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:53,519
Ugh!

403
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:10,871
<i>The trick to overcoming buyer's
remorse is to have a plan.</i>

404
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:13,789
<i>Pick one room
and make it yours.</i>

405
00:27:13,873 --> 00:27:16,333
<i>Go slowly through the house.</i>

406
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:19,211
<i>Be polite, introduce yourself,</i>

407
00:27:19,295 --> 00:27:22,090
<i>so it can introduce itself
to you.</i>

408
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,345
You did what?

409
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,723
Frances bought a house
in Tuscany!

410
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,558
And you're gonna
live there alone?

411
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:35,144
Well, I'm not there alone.
I'm there with bugs.

412
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:38,064
- How's the belly?
- It's growing.

413
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:41,609
I can't believe you did this.
Did you already sign?

414
00:27:41,692 --> 00:27:43,652
Yes.

415
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:46,907
Why? What?
You think I shouldn't have?

416
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,117
Are you telling me
I made a mistake?

417
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,745
- I don't know. Did you?
- Well, I don't know.

418
00:27:51,828 --> 00:27:55,374
You're the one who made
the "empty-shell person" speech.

419
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:57,417
Oh, yeah.
That was me.

420
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:59,627
Okay. Wow!

421
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,379
You bought a villa in Tuscany!

422
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:04,548
- So, what's the place like?
- It needs a little work.

423
00:28:04,632 --> 00:28:06,675
- Well, who's gonna do it?
- I am.

424
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:07,510
You are?

425
00:28:07,593 --> 00:28:09,638
I never realized
you were so handy.

426
00:28:09,763 --> 00:28:12,474
I can do things.
Remember, I fixed that drain?

427
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,935
The drain in your kitchen?
No, that was me.

428
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:17,187
I handed you the rubber thingy.

429
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,732
The plunger?
That was Tom.

430
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:23,859
I can't believe it.
Why did you just say his name?

431
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:27,029
I'm sorry.
I forgot. I'm sorry.

432
00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:29,615
I can make this work.
You know?

433
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:33,578
Of course I didn't mean I was
gonna do all the work myself.

434
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:35,914
I can hire the descendents
of Roman gods

435
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:37,457
to do the heavy lifting.

436
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:40,001
Then, just supervise,
tell them what to do.

437
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,671
So, have you met him yet?

438
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:44,964
- Who?
- The guy you're gonna meet.

439
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:47,049
Patti, please.

440
00:28:47,174 --> 00:28:48,759
You know what?

441
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:51,178
It's starting to rain here
a little bit.

442
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,806
- So I think I have to go now.
- Wait, Fran.

443
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:56,017
I want you to kiss
the belly for me.

444
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,477
- Fran.
- Bye-bye.

445
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,648
Can you Star-69 Italy?

446
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,691
No.

447
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,401
I'm gonna try.

448
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:08,612
Hello?

449
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:14,493
Okay.

450
00:29:24,755 --> 00:29:26,631
One 1,000,

451
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:28,508
2-- Aah!

452
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,676
Jesus!

453
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:35,681
Okay.

454
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:13,095
Stop it.

455
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:17,140
Stop it.

456
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:22,353
Oh, my God.

457
00:30:22,436 --> 00:30:24,980
Oh, my God.

458
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:29,069
You're gonna be okay.
You're safe here.

459
00:30:30,904 --> 00:30:33,740
Just don't fly around, okay?
You'll freak me out.

460
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:38,495
Oh, God.

461
00:30:50,214 --> 00:30:51,340
<i>Signora?</i>

462
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:55,721
<i>Signora Mayes?</i>

463
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:57,639
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

464
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:02,561
I see you have survived
the storm.

465
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:08,065
I'm alive.
But the washing machine is dead.

466
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:10,943
Yes.
It was electrocuted.

467
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:13,195
I'm happy to see
that you were not.

468
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:20,287
You came to check on me?

469
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:24,332
You're meeting the contractors
today, and I came to help you.

470
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,001
I believe one of them is here.

471
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:27,793
Here?

472
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:28,961
Downstairs.

473
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:36,677
Oh.

474
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:40,015
Oh, yeah.
He's here.

475
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,809
I was hoping to take
this wall down

476
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:46,063
and return these two small rooms
into one big room.

477
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:48,106
Oh, wonderful.

478
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,816
You should have been
an architect.

479
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,069
You have excellent taste.

480
00:31:53,152 --> 00:31:55,112
So, do you think it can be done?

481
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:57,823
Hidden pipes, a week.

482
00:31:57,907 --> 00:32:00,326
The bathrooms, 3 days.

483
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:03,455
<i>Signora, give me
the keys of this place,</i>

484
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:07,334
and in one month, I will give
you the keys to your palace.

485
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:09,669
Just...

486
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:13,006
Just leave it to me.

487
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:23,724
Boom! Boom! Boom!

488
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,644
Oh.

489
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:30,357
Oh!

490
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:46,122
He says he fixed it himself
many years ago.

491
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:47,957
Really?

492
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,752
Oh. You want to see
the rest of the house?

493
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,838
Okay.
Yes, yes.

494
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,720
He suggest that
he rebuild the wall.

495
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:05,224
It is important for the
structure of the garden.

496
00:33:05,307 --> 00:33:08,394
He has a team of experts.

497
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,029
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

498
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:20,115
Hello, miss.

499
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,951
<i>We are not Italian.
We are from Polonia.</i>

500
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:25,578
Poland. Oh.
Do you all speak English?

501
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:29,165
Only me.
And only a little.

502
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:30,291
I am Pawel.

503
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:32,918
Oh, Pawel.
Nice to meet you.

504
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:35,463
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

505
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:36,757
Jerzy.

506
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,175
Jerzy.

507
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:42,095
Hello.

508
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:44,765
Zbignew.

509
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:46,349
Zbignew.

510
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:49,018
Frances.

511
00:33:51,979 --> 00:33:53,481
What do you think of Nino?

512
00:33:53,522 --> 00:33:57,401
I know his mother.
If he does a bad job, he's...

513
00:33:57,485 --> 00:33:59,112
Well, then.

514
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:02,115
Okay. Yes.

515
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:03,116
Okay. Yes.

516
00:34:03,158 --> 00:34:04,785
Yes, yes.

517
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:13,667
Okay. Yes.

518
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:39,568
See, Frances?
No problem.

519
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:45,116
Nino!

520
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,660
Oh, God!

521
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,747
Run! Oh!
Aah!

522
00:35:14,688 --> 00:35:17,023
Okay. Yes.

523
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:35,500
<i>Kurwa mac!</i>

524
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:38,503
<i>"Kurwa mac"
means "holy shit" in Polish.</i>

525
00:35:38,587 --> 00:35:41,048
<i>I learned that that day.</i>

526
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:43,425
<i>The fact I'm trying to speak
Polish in Italy</i>

527
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,969
<i>is just one of the many
surprises around here.</i>

528
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,976
Is he a licensed electrician?

529
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:57,022
No. He's a licensed
literature professor.

530
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:58,982
Oh.

531
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,614
Czeslaw Milosz.

532
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:08,741
I like him.

533
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:10,826
Czeslaw Milosz.

534
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,711
<i>It is only natural getting to
know people should take time.</i>

535
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:25,926
<i>Every day I watch for
the old man with the flowers.</i>

536
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:35,101
<i>And I wonder, was he born here?</i>

537
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:37,520
<i>Did he love someone here?</i>

538
00:36:38,604 --> 00:36:40,856
<i>Did he lose someone here?</i>

539
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:52,244
<i>He doesn't seem as curious
about me, but that's all right.</i>

540
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:57,248
<i>These days, I'm something
of a loner myself.</i>

541
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:03,838
<i>I'm pretty good
at staying entertained.</i>

542
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,425
<i>Mostly, I like to hang out
at a bar I know</i>

543
00:37:06,508 --> 00:37:09,344
<i>conveniently located
in my backyard.</i>

544
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:14,599
<i>Fortunately, there are things
here you can't do alone.</i>

545
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:17,393
<i>It's my neighbor Placido who's
teaching me about olives.</i>

546
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:19,145
Today is okay.

547
00:37:19,228 --> 00:37:22,481
But never pick
when it's wet, huh?

548
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:24,024
Okay.

549
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,568
These look good.

550
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:31,324
Oh, my God.

551
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:33,243
<i>- Papà!
- Si?</i>

552
00:37:33,326 --> 00:37:35,954
- I'm finished.
- Good. Gather up the net.

553
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,373
Okay.

554
00:37:55,348 --> 00:37:57,309
<i>- Chiara!
- Si?</i>

555
00:37:57,392 --> 00:37:59,519
Go and see
if Gianni needs some help.

556
00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:01,605
Okay.

557
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,481
Go, go.

558
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:06,901
<i>Ciao.</i>

559
00:38:08,861 --> 00:38:11,072
Oops!

560
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,282
Everything okay?

561
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:14,700
<i>Si.</i>

562
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,371
<i>Grazie.</i>

563
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,420
Francesca?
Are you busy tonight?

564
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:26,754
No.

565
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,673
Then come to dinner.
It's unhealthy to eat alone.

566
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:52,696
Stop it, Mom.
It's embarrassing.

567
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,074
- Is she okay?
- Of course. She's fine.

568
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:57,493
Mama, that's enough.

569
00:38:57,576 --> 00:39:01,414
My granny's very sensitive.

570
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:03,583
She cries all day.

571
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:09,214
Are we celebrating
something in particular?

572
00:39:09,297 --> 00:39:11,091
Gratitude to the saints
for saving us

573
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:15,511
from droughts, mad dogs,
and glandular disorders.

574
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:18,139
Good evening, everybody.
Sorry I'm late.

575
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:20,266
Katherine!
Hand me your hat.

576
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,518
Do you like it?

577
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,481
I suppose it wasn't a terrible
idea, buying a villa.

578
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:30,569
Are you up there all alone?
No lord and master, no consort?

579
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:33,530
No.
Do you have one?

580
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:35,866
One? Ha!

581
00:39:42,038 --> 00:39:44,290
I knew this would happen.
Remember?

582
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:45,249
Don't blame me.

583
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:47,793
I told him not to get her
that computer.

584
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:52,049
She got an e-mail lover,
you see, from Ecuador.

585
00:39:52,132 --> 00:39:55,010
Finally, she had to
tell him her age.

586
00:39:55,677 --> 00:39:58,805
No mail!

587
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:00,848
You had it coming.

588
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,642
You're wrong.
I hurt in my heart.

589
00:40:03,726 --> 00:40:07,104
Even though I'm old,
my heart still aches.

590
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:08,981
I'm so sorry.

591
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:16,406
<i>- L'amore.
- Si.</i>

592
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:20,077
<i>Si.</i>

593
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,120
Hmm?

594
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:24,830
<i>Celibe?</i>

595
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:26,540
<i>Celibe.</i>

596
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:28,834
Celibate?

597
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:30,711
<i>- Celibate!
- Si.</i>

598
00:40:32,755 --> 00:40:35,341
No. I mean...

599
00:40:35,424 --> 00:40:41,515
Well, actually, I have to admit
it has been a while.

600
00:40:41,598 --> 00:40:43,975
<i>"Celibe" in Italian
means "single."</i>

601
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:46,186
He's not asking
when you last had sex.

602
00:40:46,228 --> 00:40:49,397
He's asking whether or not
you're married.

603
00:40:49,522 --> 00:40:51,607
Thank you.

604
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:54,360
No, I'm not.

605
00:40:55,569 --> 00:41:00,325
- Everything all right, darling?
- Oh, terrific. I'm just eating.

606
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:02,786
He is.

607
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:07,874
Oh, my God.

608
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,418
- I feel like such an idiot.
- Don't.

609
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,754
Flirting's a ritual in Italy.
Just enjoy it.

610
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,173
Taste this.
It's gorgeous.

611
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:18,926
Mmm!

612
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:22,722
- How do you do it?
- Do what?

613
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:24,433
This.

614
00:41:24,558 --> 00:41:28,186
Well, hats make me happy.

615
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,980
And ice cream.

616
00:41:30,063 --> 00:41:32,774
Ice cream changed my fate.

617
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:34,525
It was because of ice cream

618
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:37,403
that my beloved Fefe
discovered me.

619
00:41:37,445 --> 00:41:38,612
Fefe?

620
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:39,780
<i>II Maestro.</i>

621
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:40,990
Who?

622
00:41:41,073 --> 00:41:43,492
Federico, darling.

623
00:41:43,576 --> 00:41:45,119
Fellini?

624
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,999
He discovered me in the
Piazza Novena with my parents

625
00:41:49,082 --> 00:41:50,751
eating an ice cream.

626
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:52,044
I was gobbling it down,

627
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:55,464
letting it run all over my chin
because I was hungry.

628
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:57,715
"Do you like ice cream?"
He asked me.

629
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:01,552
I didn't know who he was.
I was 16.

630
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:06,057
"You are my imagination
come to life," he told me.

631
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:11,146
He wasn't just a great director.
He gave great advice.

632
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,565
I'm listening.

633
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:19,570
Fefe said you have to live
spherically in many directions.

634
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:22,740
Never lose
your childish enthusiasm,

635
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:25,451
and things will come your way.

636
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:34,961
<i>So now I was getting posthumous
advice from Il Maestro,</i>

637
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:37,172
<i>and I tried to follow it
by pulling ivy,</i>

638
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:40,467
<i>spherically
and with childish enthusiasm.</i>

639
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:45,137
Oh, my God.

640
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,566
<i>Niente qui.</i>

641
00:42:59,903 --> 00:43:02,406
<i>Niente.
Not here.</i>

642
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:10,371
Did you look under the bed?

643
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,879
Could you look under the pillow?

644
00:43:23,844 --> 00:43:25,595
Huh!

645
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:27,639
No.
It's a joke.

646
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:34,562
Maybe he moved out already.

647
00:43:34,603 --> 00:43:37,648
Snakes are famous
for changing their minds.

648
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:45,323
What am I doing here
all by myself?

649
00:43:46,408 --> 00:43:48,535
Don't you think it's strange?

650
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:50,620
Me in this big house?

651
00:43:51,913 --> 00:43:53,622
Excuse me.

652
00:43:54,707 --> 00:43:56,167
I'm sorry.

653
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:05,342
<i>You are cold, Signora Mayes.</i>

654
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:06,762
Yeah.

655
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:09,473
Thank you.

656
00:44:19,273 --> 00:44:23,444
Do you know the most surprising
thing about divorce?

657
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,405
It doesn't actually kill you,

658
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:31,244
like a bullet to the heart
or a head-on car wreck.

659
00:44:31,286 --> 00:44:32,871
It should.

660
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:38,585
When someone you've promised to
cherish till death do you part

661
00:44:38,668 --> 00:44:43,589
says, "I never loved you,"
it should kill you instantly.

662
00:44:44,757 --> 00:44:47,843
You shouldn't have to wake up
day after day after that,

663
00:44:47,968 --> 00:44:51,722
trying to understand how
in the world you didn't know.

664
00:44:51,806 --> 00:44:54,726
The light just never went on,
you know.

665
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,937
I must have have known,
of course,

666
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:01,400
but I was too scared
to see the truth.

667
00:45:01,483 --> 00:45:04,693
Then fear just makes you
so stupid.

668
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:07,363
<i>No. It's not stupid,
Signora Mayes.</i>

669
00:45:08,781 --> 00:45:10,199
<i>L'amore è cieco.</i>

670
00:45:10,282 --> 00:45:13,953
Oh, love is blind.
Yeah, we have that saying, too.

671
00:45:14,036 --> 00:45:18,542
Everybody has that saying
because it's true everywhere.

672
00:45:19,668 --> 00:45:21,962
I don't want to be blind
anymore.

673
00:45:23,004 --> 00:45:24,297
This house has three bedrooms.

674
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:26,882
What if there's never anyone
to sleep in them?

675
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:32,388
And the kitchen, what if there's
never anyone to cook for?

676
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:35,182
I wake up in the night
thinking, "You idiot.

677
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:38,102
I mean, you're the stupidest
woman in the world.

678
00:45:38,185 --> 00:45:41,773
You bought a house for a life
you don't even have."

679
00:45:44,693 --> 00:45:46,695
Why did you do it, then?

680
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,784
Because I'm sick of being afraid
all the time

681
00:45:53,868 --> 00:45:56,579
and because I still want things.

682
00:45:56,704 --> 00:45:59,957
I want a wedding in this house,

683
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:04,337
and I want a family
in this house.

684
00:46:09,384 --> 00:46:12,470
<i>Signora,
between Austria and Italy,</i>

685
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:16,557
there is a section of the Alps
called the Semmering.

686
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,352
It is an impossibly steep,
very high part of the mountains.

687
00:46:20,436 --> 00:46:22,730
They built a train track
over these Alps

688
00:46:22,855 --> 00:46:24,857
to connect Vienna and Venice.

689
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,737
They built these tracks before
there was a train in existence

690
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,781
that could make the trip.

691
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:37,870
They built it because they knew
someday the train would come.

692
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,978
I think your snake has gone
for the evening.

693
00:47:03,062 --> 00:47:05,106
Yes.
I think you're right.

694
00:47:11,987 --> 00:47:13,656
<i>Signora.</i>

695
00:47:14,908 --> 00:47:17,953
Please stop being so sad.

696
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,496
If you continue like this,

697
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:22,623
I will be forced
to make love to you.

698
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:26,001
And I've never been unfaithful
to my wife.

699
00:47:38,807 --> 00:47:40,308
<i>Buonanotte, signora.</i>

700
00:47:40,434 --> 00:47:42,394
<i>Yes.
Buonanotte, Signor Martini.</i>

701
00:47:42,477 --> 00:47:44,563
<i>Grazie.</i>

702
00:47:45,813 --> 00:47:47,189
<i>Prego.</i>

703
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:01,329
<i>A train track through the Alps
before there was a train.</i>

704
00:48:01,413 --> 00:48:03,790
<i>Signor Martini wants me
to have faith.</i>

705
00:48:03,874 --> 00:48:07,711
<i>Something I've never been good
at, and now I'm even worse at.</i>

706
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:11,464
<i>Not that I don't want faith.
I'm jealous of the believers.</i>

707
00:48:11,547 --> 00:48:13,299
<i>But as a fallen-away Methodist,</i>

708
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,635
<i>I do not expect to emerge
from all of this a Catholic,</i>

709
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:20,306
<i>although I admit some
interior juggling is going on.</i>

710
00:48:20,389 --> 00:48:23,309
<i>To my surprise, I have become
friendly with Mary.</i>

711
00:48:23,392 --> 00:48:26,646
<i>It started the night she stood
by me through the storm,</i>

712
00:48:26,688 --> 00:48:29,649
<i>knowing full well
I'm not a Catholic.</i>

713
00:48:29,733 --> 00:48:33,110
<i>Yet, somehow, she seems more
like Mary, my favorite aunt,</i>

714
00:48:33,194 --> 00:48:35,488
<i>than Santa Maria.</i>

715
00:48:35,571 --> 00:48:39,617
<i>Aunt Mary is everywhere here,
her calm presence assuring us</i>

716
00:48:39,742 --> 00:48:43,662
<i>that all things will go on
as they have before.</i>

717
00:49:02,556 --> 00:49:03,641
<i>Buon Natale.</i>

718
00:49:03,724 --> 00:49:04,809
<i>Buon Natale.</i>

719
00:49:04,892 --> 00:49:06,185
This is my wife, Flora.

720
00:49:06,227 --> 00:49:07,686
Oh!

721
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:09,146
And my daughter, Stella.

722
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,901
<i>Stella, buon Natale.</i>

723
00:49:13,026 --> 00:49:14,820
<i>Bellissima.</i>

724
00:49:14,903 --> 00:49:17,197
What a beautiful family.

725
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,490
Wow.

726
00:49:18,573 --> 00:49:21,575
I thought I might see you,
so I have a gift for you.

727
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:26,080
It is San Lorenzo.

728
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,332
He is the patron saint of cooks.

729
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:31,585
Apparently, he was martyred on a
grill and seared until he said,

730
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:33,587
"Turn me over.
I'm done on this side."

731
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:34,840
No!

732
00:49:34,923 --> 00:49:37,551
Yes. And now he is
the favorite saint of chefs.

733
00:49:37,592 --> 00:49:39,094
Oh!

734
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:41,012
I think if you prayed to him,

735
00:49:41,096 --> 00:49:43,681
he will help you find
someone to cook for.

736
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,892
<i>Thank you, Signor Martini.</i>

737
00:49:56,444 --> 00:49:57,904
<i>Merry Christmas, Signora.</i>

738
00:49:57,988 --> 00:50:00,073
<i>Buon Natale.</i>

739
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,303
<i>My prayers to San Lorenzo
were quickly answered.</i>

740
00:50:21,344 --> 00:50:25,098
<i>I realized I already
had someone to cook for.</i>

741
00:50:26,141 --> 00:50:27,934
<i>Plenty of someones.</i>

742
00:51:30,872 --> 00:51:32,332
<i>- Bravo!
- Ahh!</i>

743
00:51:35,127 --> 00:51:36,169
<i>- Bravo!
- Bravo!</i>

744
00:51:36,253 --> 00:51:37,462
<i>Bravo!</i>

745
00:51:37,546 --> 00:51:38,671
Aah!

746
00:51:38,754 --> 00:51:39,922
Aah!

747
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,931
- Good.
- See, Frances? Italian is easy.

748
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:56,565
No!

749
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,735
Aah! Aah! Aah!

750
00:52:15,624 --> 00:52:17,586
Have you talked to her yet?

751
00:52:20,297 --> 00:52:21,673
<i>Si.</i>

752
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:24,134
I have talked to her.

753
00:52:24,217 --> 00:52:26,886
Why don't you go
sit next to her? Go on.

754
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:28,471
Okay.

755
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,330
Katherine!

756
00:52:57,124 --> 00:52:59,085
Francesca!
Come up!

757
00:52:59,126 --> 00:53:00,961
I'm having my portrait painted.

758
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:04,341
Katherine?

759
00:53:04,466 --> 00:53:06,760
Come through.
I'm in here.

760
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,229
Oh.

761
00:53:21,941 --> 00:53:25,903
- I'll come back another time.
- Why? You don't bother me.

762
00:53:25,986 --> 00:53:29,741
Frances, this is Zeus.

763
00:53:29,825 --> 00:53:31,910
He's an art student
from Macedonia.

764
00:53:31,993 --> 00:53:35,413
He's staying with me while
he's studying the Tuscan light.

765
00:53:35,496 --> 00:53:37,456
<i>More vino, darling.</i>

766
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,213
Hmm.

767
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:47,717
He's not bad.

768
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,677
He's not good, either.

769
00:53:52,013 --> 00:53:55,726
Look, I'm going to go,
but I'll come back another time.

770
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:58,269
Oh, you're so boring!

771
00:53:58,352 --> 00:53:59,145
What?

772
00:53:59,186 --> 00:54:00,646
I said you're boring.

773
00:54:00,688 --> 00:54:02,815
Look at you!

774
00:54:02,898 --> 00:54:04,150
You're sad.

775
00:54:04,191 --> 00:54:05,818
Again!

776
00:54:05,901 --> 00:54:09,655
You're like a big black hole.

777
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:11,157
Excuse me, but I...

778
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,537
Fefe always said,
"Regrets are a waste of time.

779
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,708
They're the past crippling you
in the present."

780
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:21,334
I just walked in the door.

781
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:26,047
How are you ever going to be
happy if you keep wallowing?

782
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:29,675
Listen,
when I was a little girl,

783
00:54:29,759 --> 00:54:32,219
I used to spend hours
looking for ladybugs.

784
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:36,390
Finally, I'd just give up
and fall asleep in the grass.

785
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:40,395
When I woke up,
they were crawling all over me.

786
00:54:41,396 --> 00:54:42,814
So?

787
00:54:42,898 --> 00:54:47,777
So go work on your house
and forget about it.

788
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,695
I said go!

789
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:51,989
I'm going!

790
00:54:56,202 --> 00:54:59,038
<i>Work on the house
and forget about it.</i>

791
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,251
<i>Gee, why hadn't
I thought of that?</i>

792
00:55:04,419 --> 00:55:07,339
<i>There comes a time
in every remodeler's life</i>

793
00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:10,216
<i>when one doesn't want
any more helpful advice.</i>

794
00:55:10,299 --> 00:55:13,552
<i>There comes a time when you
no longer want shaky guys</i>

795
00:55:13,636 --> 00:55:15,679
<i>staring at you thinking
God knows what,</i>

796
00:55:15,763 --> 00:55:16,931
<i>whispering things in Polish</i>

797
00:55:17,056 --> 00:55:19,642
<i>you're really glad
you don't understand.</i>

798
00:55:23,229 --> 00:55:26,233
<i>There's only so much you can
take before there comes a time</i>

799
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:28,318
<i>when you just have to get out.</i>

800
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:06,939
<i>Signorina.</i>

801
00:56:07,022 --> 00:56:08,315
<i>Bella!</i>

802
00:56:08,399 --> 00:56:09,608
Great.

803
00:56:12,237 --> 00:56:13,947
Hilarious.

804
00:56:14,573 --> 00:56:16,366
Goodbye!

805
00:56:28,627 --> 00:56:31,130
You are American?

806
00:56:31,213 --> 00:56:33,299
English? Irish?

807
00:56:36,094 --> 00:56:38,180
There you are.
I've been looking for you.

808
00:56:38,263 --> 00:56:39,514
You said you were gonna meet me.

809
00:56:39,598 --> 00:56:42,391
I've been looking for you
for 20 minutes.

810
00:56:42,475 --> 00:56:44,393
- Who are you?
- I'm sorry.

811
00:56:44,477 --> 00:56:46,729
<i>Mi scusi.
Thank you.</i>

812
00:56:46,812 --> 00:56:49,315
Wait. You just kissed me
and you're going?

813
00:56:49,398 --> 00:56:50,733
Yes.

814
00:56:50,816 --> 00:56:52,610
I'm sorry.

815
00:56:54,403 --> 00:56:55,571
Okay.

816
00:57:20,554 --> 00:57:21,932
You are too late.

817
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:23,058
I'm sorry?

818
00:57:23,141 --> 00:57:25,644
I've already found
somebody else.

819
00:57:28,229 --> 00:57:29,814
My loss.

820
00:57:31,857 --> 00:57:33,025
I was wondering
if you'd help me.

821
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:34,652
I'm trying to find
an antique store

822
00:57:34,777 --> 00:57:37,696
that sells replacement parts
for a chandelier.

823
00:57:37,738 --> 00:57:39,448
Chandelier.

824
00:57:39,532 --> 00:57:40,866
<i>- Vetre-ria.
- Vetreria.</i>

825
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:43,369
<i>- Vetreria, yes.
- Okay.</i>

826
00:57:43,452 --> 00:57:45,872
<i>Via di La Casanova.</i>

827
00:57:45,914 --> 00:57:47,290
<i>Ah, Via di La Casanova.</i>

828
00:57:47,374 --> 00:57:49,209
<i>- Si.
- You know it?</i>

829
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:50,210
No.

830
00:57:50,293 --> 00:57:51,377
Oh.

831
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,754
But I know where there is
another store.

832
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:56,674
<i>- My cousin owns one.
- Your cousin owns a vetreria?</i>

833
00:57:56,716 --> 00:57:59,009
Yes. Antiques.

834
00:57:59,093 --> 00:58:00,094
Is it far?

835
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:01,679
About three hours.

836
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:04,432
Two if I drive fast.

837
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:05,224
Two hours?

838
00:58:05,307 --> 00:58:12,315
Okay. One if I drive really,
really, really fast.

839
00:58:12,441 --> 00:58:16,861
That's very nice, but thank you.
No.

840
00:58:16,944 --> 00:58:21,782
I know you think maybe I'm
just trying to pull you up.

841
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:24,160
Pull me up?

842
00:58:24,243 --> 00:58:25,578
Pick me up.

843
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:27,705
Pick me up.

844
00:58:27,747 --> 00:58:29,248
Yes.
There is that chance.

845
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:33,336
But you are the one who grabbed
me and pretend I'm your husband.

846
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,756
You're probably one of those
crazy American women

847
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:39,633
like "Charlie's Angels",
and you are going to kung-fu me

848
00:58:39,759 --> 00:58:40,968
and steal my car.

849
00:58:41,093 --> 00:58:43,304
But I'm willing to take
the chance.

850
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:44,847
You're willing?

851
00:58:46,932 --> 00:58:48,851
What is your name?

852
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:50,519
Marcello.

853
00:58:51,645 --> 00:58:52,897
Of course it is.

854
00:58:59,237 --> 00:59:01,072
Do traffic lights mean anything?

855
00:59:01,155 --> 00:59:02,615
Sure.

856
00:59:02,656 --> 00:59:04,367
<i>Green light.
Avanti, avanti.</i>

857
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,827
<i>- Avanti.
- Yellow light. Decoration.</i>

858
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:08,496
And what about red lights?

859
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:10,247
Just a suggestion.

860
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:43,115
Marcello. You're crazy.

861
00:59:43,198 --> 00:59:45,826
Thanks a lot.

862
00:59:45,951 --> 00:59:46,993
He doesn't have it.

863
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,787
Why am I not surprised?

864
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:53,165
- Uncle, I want an ice cream.
- You want an ice cream?

865
00:59:53,249 --> 00:59:55,668
- How many have you had today?
- Two.

866
00:59:55,710 --> 01:00:00,965
Only two? Then get another one.
Give me a kiss first.

867
01:00:03,843 --> 01:00:07,806
Maria, get her an ice cream.
Nice and big.

868
01:00:07,848 --> 01:00:09,558
This is your bar?

869
01:00:09,641 --> 01:00:12,518
We are a family.
I work here.

870
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,354
And I sleep there.

871
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:17,606
Above my cousin's antique store.

872
01:00:21,569 --> 01:00:22,820
Did you ever taste this?

873
01:00:22,903 --> 01:00:24,739
<i>- What is that?
- It's limoncello.</i>

874
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:25,698
We made this.

875
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,950
- You made it?
- Yeah.

876
01:00:28,034 --> 01:00:32,164
We take the lemon, and we take
off the skin of the lemon,

877
01:00:32,205 --> 01:00:34,540
and then we put in the bottle

878
01:00:34,623 --> 01:00:39,128
with 3/4 of alcohol
and 1/4 of sugar.

879
01:00:39,211 --> 01:00:40,796
Mm-hmm.

880
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:48,137
And you put the skin
of the lemon in the bottle,

881
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:53,852
and you leave it
until it's dried color.

882
01:00:55,103 --> 01:01:00,941
And I forget the rest.

883
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:02,943
But just try it.

884
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:12,453
- Do you like it?
- I like it.

885
01:01:14,747 --> 01:01:17,834
You got your ice cream.
Bravo.

886
01:01:19,086 --> 01:01:21,212
My nephew.

887
01:01:21,295 --> 01:01:22,421
Yes.

888
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:59,291
Hello.

889
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:01,711
Well, hello.

890
01:02:01,794 --> 01:02:04,214
Hello.

891
01:02:04,297 --> 01:02:07,216
Oh!

892
01:02:07,299 --> 01:02:09,009
<i>Ciao.</i>

893
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:10,386
<i>Ciao.</i>

894
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,225
<i>Veramente? No.</i>

895
01:02:16,308 --> 01:02:18,227
What?

896
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:21,439
He says,
"Take me home with you."

897
01:02:21,522 --> 01:02:22,481
He does, does he?

898
01:02:22,565 --> 01:02:24,400
<i>Esattamente.</i>

899
01:02:24,483 --> 01:02:27,237
<i>Ciao, piccolo, Ciao.
Ciao.</i>

900
01:02:37,997 --> 01:02:43,127
I run into you in the street
in Rome, and now we're here.

901
01:02:43,169 --> 01:02:44,837
Didn't you have plans today?

902
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,673
Didn't you have something
you had to do?

903
01:02:49,718 --> 01:02:52,471
So what?

904
01:02:52,512 --> 01:02:54,805
If you smash
into something good,

905
01:02:54,889 --> 01:03:00,978
you should hold on
until it's time to let go.

906
01:03:01,937 --> 01:03:03,856
And now is not the time.

907
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,860
Not in my opinion.

908
01:03:08,944 --> 01:03:10,196
No.

909
01:03:15,285 --> 01:03:17,995
You have beautiful eyes,
Francesca.

910
01:03:19,121 --> 01:03:22,333
I wish I could swim inside them.

911
01:03:27,963 --> 01:03:28,422
What?

912
01:03:28,506 --> 01:03:31,884
No. It's just that's
exactly what American women

913
01:03:31,926 --> 01:03:34,804
think Italian men say.

914
01:03:34,887 --> 01:03:37,557
I guess.

915
01:03:40,185 --> 01:03:41,560
Thank you.

916
01:03:47,691 --> 01:03:49,777
Marcello, I'm sorry.

917
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,779
I'm so sorry.

918
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:57,368
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous, you know.

919
01:03:57,451 --> 01:03:59,621
I was married for a long time.

920
01:03:59,705 --> 01:04:03,458
And since then,
there hasn't been anybody.

921
01:04:07,586 --> 01:04:10,256
Would you like to help me
change that?

922
01:04:14,093 --> 01:04:16,762
You are asking me
to sleep with you?

923
01:04:17,805 --> 01:04:19,181
Yes.

924
01:04:20,433 --> 01:04:21,934
Hmm.

925
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:24,646
That is exactly
the kind of thing

926
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,773
we Italian men think
American women say.

927
01:04:26,857 --> 01:04:29,066
Oh!

928
01:04:29,108 --> 01:04:30,484
Yeah.

929
01:04:33,612 --> 01:04:36,282
You honor me with your offer.

930
01:05:22,286 --> 01:05:23,537
Francesca.

931
01:05:23,621 --> 01:05:25,081
Yes?

932
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:31,170
I'm going to make love
all over you.

933
01:05:31,253 --> 01:05:32,631
Okay.

934
01:05:42,264 --> 01:05:43,933
Okay.

935
01:05:47,478 --> 01:05:49,271
Ohh!

936
01:05:49,355 --> 01:05:50,773
Yeah.

937
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,893
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

938
01:06:29,103 --> 01:06:30,438
<i>Che bella spalla.</i>

939
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:33,023
<i>- What is spalla?
- Shoulder.</i>

940
01:06:36,736 --> 01:06:38,779
And what do you call this?

941
01:06:38,863 --> 01:06:40,573
<i>La gola.</i>

942
01:06:40,614 --> 01:06:41,699
<i>La gola.</i>

943
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:43,577
Mm-hmm.

944
01:06:43,618 --> 01:06:45,120
And this?

945
01:06:46,121 --> 01:06:47,580
<i>Il capezzolo.</i>

946
01:06:47,621 --> 01:06:48,914
<i>Il capezzolo.</i>

947
01:06:48,956 --> 01:06:49,957
Uh-huh.

948
01:06:51,417 --> 01:06:53,169
And this?

949
01:06:55,588 --> 01:06:56,839
<i>Esausto.</i>

950
01:06:56,922 --> 01:06:57,882
Exhausted?

951
01:06:57,965 --> 01:06:59,759
Exhausted.

952
01:06:59,842 --> 01:07:04,221
At least for the next 5 minutes.

953
01:07:04,263 --> 01:07:05,891
Okay.

954
01:07:06,892 --> 01:07:08,226
Okay.

955
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:11,979
Me too.

956
01:07:15,316 --> 01:07:18,652
It's terrible that you bought
that villa in Cortona.

957
01:07:18,736 --> 01:07:19,737
Why?

958
01:07:22,073 --> 01:07:26,202
Because it's not in Positano,
and I am.

959
01:07:28,954 --> 01:07:32,667
You have to promise
to come back here.

960
01:07:32,751 --> 01:07:34,960
Promise me.

961
01:07:35,044 --> 01:07:36,670
When?

962
01:07:37,797 --> 01:07:39,757
Can you come this weekend?

963
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:44,011
I think so.

964
01:07:45,471 --> 01:07:46,764
You think so?

965
01:07:46,806 --> 01:07:49,058
Hmm.

966
01:07:49,141 --> 01:07:50,976
You think so?

967
01:07:57,775 --> 01:08:01,028
Yes! Yes! Yes!

968
01:08:01,112 --> 01:08:01,946
Yes!

969
01:08:01,987 --> 01:08:02,947
Yes!

970
01:08:02,988 --> 01:08:05,157
Yes!

971
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:07,326
Thank you.
Thank you.

972
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:10,454
<i># I knew it, I knew it,
I knew it #</i>

973
01:08:10,538 --> 01:08:12,123
Whoo!
I still got it.

974
01:08:12,206 --> 01:08:13,666
I still got it.

975
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:14,875
I still got it!

976
01:08:14,959 --> 01:08:16,920
Thank God!

977
01:08:18,797 --> 01:08:19,673
Oh, yeah.

978
01:08:28,723 --> 01:08:30,182
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

979
01:08:32,727 --> 01:08:34,645
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

980
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:36,230
Do I still look sad to you?

981
01:08:36,313 --> 01:08:38,190
No.

982
01:08:38,232 --> 01:08:39,985
Ladybugs, Katherine.

983
01:08:40,026 --> 01:08:42,070
Lots and lots of ladybugs.

984
01:08:42,195 --> 01:08:45,406
Lovely.
When do you see him again?

985
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:46,907
Tomorrow.

986
01:09:14,393 --> 01:09:15,686
What?

987
01:09:15,728 --> 01:09:17,188
What?

988
01:09:17,229 --> 01:09:18,814
Oh!

989
01:09:18,898 --> 01:09:19,899
Ha!

990
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:24,445
I would have told you
I was coming,

991
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:26,782
but you would have
talked me out of flying.

992
01:09:29,576 --> 01:09:31,911
Oh, look at you!

993
01:09:31,952 --> 01:09:34,163
God damn it, Frances.

994
01:09:36,665 --> 01:09:39,251
- I...
- What?

995
01:09:39,335 --> 01:09:40,920
I gotta go pee!

996
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:45,549
You must be so exhausted.

997
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:46,675
Oh!

998
01:09:46,759 --> 01:09:49,846
Pbht! See this?

999
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:52,391
Tell me there's a baby in there.

1000
01:09:52,432 --> 01:09:53,724
Mm-hmm.

1001
01:09:55,601 --> 01:09:58,813
Big old baby in there.

1002
01:09:58,896 --> 01:10:00,731
Right now.

1003
01:10:02,024 --> 01:10:03,442
I'm with you.

1004
01:10:07,113 --> 01:10:08,697
Oh, jeez.

1005
01:10:14,454 --> 01:10:17,748
So, what's it like
having one of these in Cortona?

1006
01:10:18,791 --> 01:10:20,751
I hear the town midwife's good.

1007
01:10:20,876 --> 01:10:24,630
She puts a knife under the bed
to cut the pain.

1008
01:10:25,965 --> 01:10:28,092
Florence is an hour away.

1009
01:10:28,175 --> 01:10:29,468
You're gonna deliver this baby

1010
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:32,304
in a hospital gown
designed by Armani.

1011
01:10:54,744 --> 01:10:57,204
She ran out on me.

1012
01:10:58,581 --> 01:11:04,128
She said she realized she didn't
want to be a mother after all.

1013
01:11:12,803 --> 01:11:16,307
Oh, disaster, Frances.

1014
01:11:20,144 --> 01:11:22,354
How do you do it?

1015
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:29,278
How do you ever breathe again?

1016
01:11:37,036 --> 01:11:38,704
Pretty soon.

1017
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:46,003
God, I missed you.

1018
01:11:46,045 --> 01:11:51,300
Marcello, I really
think I'd better stay here.

1019
01:11:51,384 --> 01:11:54,845
Oh, I'm sorry.
How about next weekend?

1020
01:11:54,887 --> 01:11:57,390
Okay, well how about
the one after that?

1021
01:11:58,599 --> 01:12:01,685
No, of course, I understand.

1022
01:12:01,769 --> 01:12:04,105
I won't forget you.

1023
01:12:05,106 --> 01:12:07,316
I think a lot about you, too.

1024
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,526
Okay.

1025
01:12:08,609 --> 01:12:11,363
Well, until then.

1026
01:12:11,405 --> 01:12:12,780
Bye.

1027
01:12:14,573 --> 01:12:17,910
There's something strange
about these trees.

1028
01:12:17,993 --> 01:12:19,120
It's like they know.

1029
01:12:19,203 --> 01:12:22,039
And they know
that we know that they know.

1030
01:12:22,081 --> 01:12:25,501
They're creepy.
Creepy Italian trees.

1031
01:12:25,584 --> 01:12:26,460
The baby's gonna like them

1032
01:12:26,544 --> 01:12:28,254
'cause it's gonna be
a creepy Italian baby

1033
01:12:28,295 --> 01:12:30,005
<i>who goes around saying,
"Ciao, Mamma,"</i>

1034
01:12:30,089 --> 01:12:34,553
and doing that backward
hand-wave thing.

1035
01:12:36,345 --> 01:12:38,764
Life is strange.

1036
01:12:44,186 --> 01:12:46,605
Where were you going
when I arrived?

1037
01:12:46,689 --> 01:12:48,274
Nowhere important.

1038
01:12:48,357 --> 01:12:50,151
What's he like?

1039
01:12:50,234 --> 01:12:51,944
He's a creepy Italian.

1040
01:12:52,027 --> 01:12:54,447
- So go see him.
- I will.

1041
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:57,784
I want to spend time
with my creepy American friend.

1042
01:12:57,868 --> 01:13:00,077
I refuse to screw up
your love life.

1043
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:02,204
Don't be ridiculous, Patti.

1044
01:13:02,288 --> 01:13:04,498
You are my love life.

1045
01:14:05,726 --> 01:14:09,688
Frances,
could you come up here, please?

1046
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:12,149
There's hot water
in the toilet bowl.

1047
01:14:15,111 --> 01:14:16,654
Oh, my God.

1048
01:14:16,779 --> 01:14:19,281
- That's close to boiling.
- Mm-hmm.

1049
01:14:19,365 --> 01:14:22,034
They must have crossed
a pipe somewhere.

1050
01:14:22,118 --> 01:14:24,120
Oh, this is really bad,
isn't it?

1051
01:14:24,203 --> 01:14:28,290
Well, it's not good, unless you
want to give your ass a facial.

1052
01:14:28,374 --> 01:14:30,961
That's a contradiction in terms.

1053
01:14:31,044 --> 01:14:35,339
I guess it'd be more
of an ass-cial.

1054
01:14:50,354 --> 01:14:52,732
Oh, God. Go.
Go, go, go.

1055
01:14:52,773 --> 01:14:54,484
I'm sorry, Frances!

1056
01:14:54,568 --> 01:14:56,902
He's sorry.

1057
01:14:56,986 --> 01:14:59,155
We have nowhere else
to be together.

1058
01:14:59,238 --> 01:15:00,656
What does that make me?

1059
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:04,577
Saint Francesca,
patron saint of horny teenagers?

1060
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,620
Pawel, you were doing it
in my bed.

1061
01:15:06,704 --> 01:15:08,289
I don't even do it in my bed.

1062
01:15:08,372 --> 01:15:10,291
Please, Francesca, help us.

1063
01:15:10,374 --> 01:15:13,252
My father don't let us see
each other.

1064
01:15:13,294 --> 01:15:16,005
Maybe he thinks you're young
and shouldn't be...

1065
01:15:16,088 --> 01:15:18,216
It's because I'm Polish.

1066
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,718
It will be terrible
if we are not together.

1067
01:15:30,936 --> 01:15:33,564
"Assassinate."
Did you say "assassinate"?

1068
01:15:33,606 --> 01:15:36,025
Did she say you were going
to assassinate somebody?

1069
01:15:36,108 --> 01:15:38,778
No, she misunderstand.

1070
01:15:38,861 --> 01:15:40,614
I didn't say...

1071
01:15:40,697 --> 01:15:44,075
<i>Amore, I didn't say,
"assassino."</i>

1072
01:15:44,116 --> 01:15:47,370
I said, "I'm going to ask Nino"

1073
01:15:47,453 --> 01:15:51,248
for money to help us
get married.

1074
01:15:51,332 --> 01:15:54,251
- Oh!
- "Ask Nino." Oh!

1075
01:15:54,293 --> 01:15:57,088
I didn't understand.

1076
01:15:57,171 --> 01:15:57,963
Married?

1077
01:15:58,005 --> 01:16:00,674
You barely understand
what the other is saying.

1078
01:16:00,758 --> 01:16:02,802
We are in love.

1079
01:16:02,885 --> 01:16:04,805
And I go with him this weekend.

1080
01:16:04,846 --> 01:16:08,849
To the flag-throwing festival.
I am going to throw the flag.

1081
01:16:08,933 --> 01:16:11,143
Throw the flag.
Why?

1082
01:16:11,227 --> 01:16:14,855
Because I can do it
as good as any Italian man.

1083
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:16,357
That's why.

1084
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,983
And her father will see.

1085
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:19,652
Francesca?

1086
01:16:19,735 --> 01:16:22,029
- Francesca?
- My father.

1087
01:16:23,072 --> 01:16:25,700
- Francesca.
- Placido, hi.

1088
01:16:25,825 --> 01:16:27,744
My daughter says
you are taking her

1089
01:16:27,828 --> 01:16:30,663
<i>to the festa in Montepulciano.</i>

1090
01:16:30,746 --> 01:16:31,789
This is true?

1091
01:16:31,872 --> 01:16:34,250
Just a moment, please.

1092
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:40,214
I told him you're taking me
so he will stay home.

1093
01:16:40,297 --> 01:16:42,383
I don't want to lie
to your father.

1094
01:16:42,466 --> 01:16:45,344
Come on, Frances.
Who cares?

1095
01:16:45,386 --> 01:16:46,971
Frances?

1096
01:16:47,972 --> 01:16:52,476
If I am not with her,
I will die of a broken heart.

1097
01:16:55,688 --> 01:16:57,148
You won't die.

1098
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:16,375
Isn't he great?

1099
01:17:23,174 --> 01:17:25,134
Oh, there he is!

1100
01:17:30,723 --> 01:17:32,725
These are straight men.

1101
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:35,728
In tights twirling flags.

1102
01:17:36,312 --> 01:17:38,440
- Fantastic!
- Yeah.

1103
01:17:42,902 --> 01:17:45,488
Oh, this is it!

1104
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:51,077
He is fantastic!

1105
01:17:53,746 --> 01:17:55,873
<i>Fantastico!</i>

1106
01:18:16,435 --> 01:18:17,770
Whoo!

1107
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:41,669
<i>- Yay! Bravo!
- Bravo!</i>

1108
01:18:45,464 --> 01:18:49,051
Pawel, I love you!

1109
01:18:50,302 --> 01:18:50,970
Oh!

1110
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,604
<i>Pawel!
Mi scusi. Pawel!</i>

1111
01:19:00,646 --> 01:19:02,565
- Oh, oh.
- Easy.

1112
01:19:02,648 --> 01:19:04,316
Easy. Easy.

1113
01:19:05,151 --> 01:19:06,652
<i>Mi scusi.</i>

1114
01:19:11,991 --> 01:19:13,117
I throw the flag.

1115
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,827
<i>Si, amore.</i>

1116
01:19:18,873 --> 01:19:20,708
They're fine.

1117
01:19:22,001 --> 01:19:23,461
Let's go.

1118
01:19:23,544 --> 01:19:28,507
<i>What is it about love
that makes us so stupid?</i>

1119
01:19:30,384 --> 01:19:32,178
<i>Take the man with the flowers.</i>

1120
01:19:32,261 --> 01:19:33,972
<i>Same deal every day.</i>

1121
01:19:34,014 --> 01:19:35,556
<i>I mean, enough already.</i>

1122
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:39,018
<i>Why can he just let it go
and get over it?</i>

1123
01:19:49,945 --> 01:19:51,989
Francesca, you see my daughter?

1124
01:19:52,073 --> 01:19:54,033
She seems so different.

1125
01:19:54,075 --> 01:19:56,827
- Really?
- Oh, Chiara is not herself.

1126
01:19:56,869 --> 01:19:57,871
Oh.

1127
01:19:57,954 --> 01:20:02,541
Maybe do you know
what's bothering her?

1128
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:04,543
Placido, I don't know.

1129
01:20:04,627 --> 01:20:05,378
Oh.

1130
01:20:05,461 --> 01:20:09,882
Hey, Frances, look.
You can see Bramasole from here.

1131
01:20:09,965 --> 01:20:11,092
See?

1132
01:20:11,967 --> 01:20:13,511
Thank you.

1133
01:20:22,728 --> 01:20:23,979
It's Marcello!

1134
01:20:24,063 --> 01:20:25,940
Oh, my God!

1135
01:20:29,527 --> 01:20:31,195
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1136
01:20:31,237 --> 01:20:33,572
What's he doing?
Don't go!

1137
01:20:33,614 --> 01:20:35,533
Where are you going?

1138
01:20:35,574 --> 01:20:36,617
Patti!

1139
01:20:36,701 --> 01:20:37,993
Marcello!

1140
01:20:38,077 --> 01:20:39,704
Marcello!

1141
01:20:44,751 --> 01:20:46,585
Marcello! Ah!

1142
01:20:52,174 --> 01:20:53,342
Marcello!

1143
01:20:59,473 --> 01:21:01,600
Aaah!

1144
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:05,521
Wait!

1145
01:21:09,108 --> 01:21:11,110
Marcello!

1146
01:21:14,697 --> 01:21:18,909
We tried you on your cell,
but you were in a dead zone.

1147
01:21:18,951 --> 01:21:21,120
I cannot believe
you let him leave.

1148
01:21:21,203 --> 01:21:23,789
- He said he couldn't wait.
- Couldn't wait?

1149
01:21:23,873 --> 01:21:26,417
- Why?
- He was on his way to Arezzo.

1150
01:21:26,459 --> 01:21:28,085
He was nearby
and thought he'd take a shot.

1151
01:21:28,169 --> 01:21:30,379
He was very disappointed, okay?

1152
01:21:30,463 --> 01:21:32,298
You've got a snail in your ear.

1153
01:21:32,381 --> 01:21:32,965
Good.

1154
01:21:33,049 --> 01:21:33,591
Really?

1155
01:21:33,674 --> 01:21:35,676
No!
Get it out!

1156
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:37,470
He left you a note.

1157
01:21:40,306 --> 01:21:42,141
Hold still.

1158
01:21:42,183 --> 01:21:46,062
He's going north
for a couple of weeks.

1159
01:21:50,983 --> 01:21:51,859
Oh, my God.

1160
01:21:51,942 --> 01:21:54,112
He had a dream
about me in a white dress.

1161
01:21:54,154 --> 01:21:56,030
A white dress?
Holy shit!

1162
01:21:56,113 --> 01:21:59,492
Damn it, Patti,
why didn't you make him wait?

1163
01:21:59,575 --> 01:22:01,535
I mean, come on,
You're a tough dyke.

1164
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:04,121
You could have tied him
to a chair!

1165
01:22:04,246 --> 01:22:07,958
You could have
faked labor at least!

1166
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,127
I wouldn't have had to fake it.

1167
01:22:15,174 --> 01:22:17,803
Ten fingers.
Ten toes.

1168
01:22:20,805 --> 01:22:23,808
I commend you
on a classic choice.

1169
01:22:26,352 --> 01:22:27,686
What's her name, Mom?

1170
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:29,355
Alexandra.

1171
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,358
Alexandra.

1172
01:22:35,194 --> 01:22:38,531
<i>In Italian, the literal
translation of "to give birth,"</i>

1173
01:22:38,614 --> 01:22:42,034
<i>"dare alla luce,"
is to give to the light.</i>

1174
01:22:42,076 --> 01:22:44,245
Alexandra.

1175
01:22:45,955 --> 01:22:47,873
Welcome to the light.

1176
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:52,336
All right.

1177
01:22:52,378 --> 01:22:53,212
Hi!

1178
01:22:53,254 --> 01:22:55,673
Yes! Yes!

1179
01:22:56,882 --> 01:22:58,884
Hello, sweetheart.

1180
01:22:58,968 --> 01:23:00,386
Alexandra.

1181
01:23:00,386 --> 01:23:02,930
Alexandra.

1182
01:23:03,055 --> 01:23:04,890
Okay, I can...

1183
01:23:04,932 --> 01:23:06,934
Hey, baby.

1184
01:23:07,017 --> 01:23:09,437
Oh, you're so cute.
You're so cute.

1185
01:23:20,281 --> 01:23:21,407
Oh!

1186
01:23:40,968 --> 01:23:42,887
Frances.

1187
01:23:45,264 --> 01:23:47,558
We are finished.

1188
01:24:11,957 --> 01:24:13,459
Poland.

1189
01:24:31,268 --> 01:24:32,853
<i>Dziekuje.</i>

1190
01:24:35,272 --> 01:24:36,607
<i>Dziekuje.</i>

1191
01:25:06,554 --> 01:25:09,056
Come back soon.
I'll cook for you.

1192
01:25:10,057 --> 01:25:11,183
Pawel, you too?

1193
01:25:11,267 --> 01:25:13,644
Chiara is waiting!

1194
01:25:18,232 --> 01:25:21,819
Patti, you want to
come with me to town?

1195
01:25:21,902 --> 01:25:23,529
We could bring the baby.

1196
01:26:57,789 --> 01:27:00,167
I have to buy a white dress.

1197
01:27:15,266 --> 01:27:16,767
Excuse me.

1198
01:27:16,809 --> 01:27:21,062
- Could you give me a lift?
- With pleasure.

1199
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,357
<i>Grazie.</i>

1200
01:27:44,544 --> 01:27:45,546
<i>Grazie.</i>

1201
01:27:45,629 --> 01:27:49,341
I could wait and take you back.

1202
01:27:49,383 --> 01:27:52,636
Thanks, but I've got
my boyfriend.

1203
01:28:00,853 --> 01:28:02,480
Marcello!

1204
01:28:03,689 --> 01:28:05,316
Marcello!

1205
01:28:07,817 --> 01:28:09,612
Francesca.

1206
01:28:09,695 --> 01:28:11,906
Wait there, I'm coming down.

1207
01:28:20,998 --> 01:28:22,166
Francesca.

1208
01:28:23,459 --> 01:28:26,504
Look how beautiful you are.

1209
01:28:26,587 --> 01:28:28,881
It's incredible to see you.

1210
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:33,552
Every time we made plans,
it didn't happen.

1211
01:28:33,594 --> 01:28:36,138
So this time, I thought
I'll surprise you.

1212
01:28:36,222 --> 01:28:38,224
I am surprised.

1213
01:28:40,309 --> 01:28:42,144
What brings you to Positano?

1214
01:28:42,228 --> 01:28:45,022
What brings me to Positano?

1215
01:28:47,191 --> 01:28:49,860
What brings me to Positano?

1216
01:28:49,944 --> 01:28:51,362
Marcello.

1217
01:28:51,404 --> 01:28:53,364
We're going to be late.

1218
01:28:53,406 --> 01:28:55,241
One moment, darling.

1219
01:28:55,282 --> 01:28:57,451
I'll be right there.

1220
01:29:02,707 --> 01:29:04,208
Wow.

1221
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:08,921
I came at a bad time.

1222
01:29:09,004 --> 01:29:11,924
Francesca, wait.
Wait. Wait!

1223
01:29:11,924 --> 01:29:15,052
I'm sorry you're hurt.
But what did you expect?

1224
01:29:15,177 --> 01:29:17,221
What did I expect?

1225
01:29:17,346 --> 01:29:20,266
You came to Bramasole.
You left that note.

1226
01:29:20,349 --> 01:29:21,642
I thought that you...

1227
01:29:21,726 --> 01:29:23,602
Wait.
Just a minute.

1228
01:29:23,644 --> 01:29:26,897
Months ago,
we had a beautiful affair.

1229
01:29:26,939 --> 01:29:31,068
And if you think I wanted more
of you after that, you're right.

1230
01:29:31,152 --> 01:29:33,779
Because I did, of course.

1231
01:29:33,863 --> 01:29:36,907
You're a fantastic woman,
Francesca.

1232
01:29:36,949 --> 01:29:39,076
But we were never able
to come together again,

1233
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:41,327
even though we tried.

1234
01:29:41,411 --> 01:29:44,165
And this sort of thing
must come naturally.

1235
01:29:47,543 --> 01:29:49,545
I told you.

1236
01:29:49,628 --> 01:29:51,839
There was my friend.
She was going to have a baby.

1237
01:29:51,922 --> 01:29:54,675
There were many,
many other things.

1238
01:29:56,427 --> 01:29:58,721
Important things you had to do.

1239
01:30:00,514 --> 01:30:02,558
And you couldn't wait.

1240
01:30:03,768 --> 01:30:04,893
Right?

1241
01:30:09,023 --> 01:30:11,233
Don't worry, Francesca.

1242
01:30:11,317 --> 01:30:12,735
Don't worry.

1243
01:30:13,986 --> 01:30:16,030
There is nothing to regret.

1244
01:30:17,323 --> 01:30:19,200
Do you regret this?

1245
01:30:21,077 --> 01:30:22,411
I don't...

1246
01:30:27,624 --> 01:30:30,628
There is someone for you,
Francesca.

1247
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:42,932
Goodbye.

1248
01:30:51,523 --> 01:30:53,025
Francesca!

1249
01:31:15,548 --> 01:31:18,134
She's in the fountain!

1250
01:31:18,217 --> 01:31:20,970
- Who is in the fountain?
- The crazy blonde!

1251
01:31:30,563 --> 01:31:32,773
What's going on here?

1252
01:31:32,898 --> 01:31:37,193
She is Sylvia
in "La Dolce Vita."

1253
01:31:40,614 --> 01:31:42,616
She's very good, actually.

1254
01:31:48,748 --> 01:31:50,291
Is she drunk?

1255
01:31:50,374 --> 01:31:51,876
I hope so.

1256
01:31:58,924 --> 01:32:03,596
You know, in "La Dolce Vita,"
he goes in and he gets her.

1257
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:09,060
Mastroianni. He goes in,
and he fishes her out.

1258
01:32:43,135 --> 01:32:44,553
Katherine.

1259
01:32:59,944 --> 01:33:01,487
Thank you.

1260
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:08,953
Do you think I make
a good Sylvia?

1261
01:33:09,078 --> 01:33:10,162
You were wonderful.

1262
01:33:10,287 --> 01:33:11,329
Oh.

1263
01:33:14,917 --> 01:33:16,127
Here.

1264
01:33:20,172 --> 01:33:23,008
I see Zeus is gone.

1265
01:33:23,092 --> 01:33:25,261
Back to Mount Olympus.

1266
01:33:25,344 --> 01:33:27,388
I'm so sorry.

1267
01:33:27,471 --> 01:33:30,933
Don't be.
I'm fine now.

1268
01:33:31,016 --> 01:33:34,352
There's nothing like a fountain
and a magnum of French champagne

1269
01:33:34,436 --> 01:33:37,189
to put you right again.

1270
01:33:38,357 --> 01:33:39,692
Really?

1271
01:33:41,986 --> 01:33:43,779
What do you think?

1272
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:53,122
Oh.

1273
01:34:04,967 --> 01:34:09,847
You know who I really love
the most from all the films?

1274
01:34:10,848 --> 01:34:12,516
Cabiria.

1275
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:16,812
You remember at the end

1276
01:34:16,896 --> 01:34:20,857
when another man has left her
in the most terrible way,

1277
01:34:20,982 --> 01:34:23,527
and she thinks
it's all over for her?

1278
01:34:25,571 --> 01:34:29,241
Then she sees some children
playing in the street,

1279
01:34:29,325 --> 01:34:31,077
making music.

1280
01:34:32,203 --> 01:34:34,372
And before she knows it...

1281
01:34:35,581 --> 01:34:37,583
she's smiling again.

1282
01:34:40,252 --> 01:34:43,546
That's what Fefe always said.

1283
01:34:43,588 --> 01:34:46,884
No matter what happens...

1284
01:34:48,844 --> 01:34:52,056
always keep
your childish innocence.

1285
01:34:53,933 --> 01:34:58,521
It's the most important thing.

1286
01:35:17,164 --> 01:35:18,749
You're back?
What happened?

1287
01:35:18,833 --> 01:35:20,292
How'd it go with Marcello?

1288
01:35:20,418 --> 01:35:22,086
I don't want to talk about it.

1289
01:35:22,128 --> 01:35:23,546
Chiara's here.
She's upset.

1290
01:35:23,629 --> 01:35:27,466
She's out in the garden
talking with Pawel.

1291
01:35:27,508 --> 01:35:29,385
I can't talk about it now.

1292
01:35:29,468 --> 01:35:31,594
Oh. Fran.

1293
01:35:49,864 --> 01:35:51,907
Stupid.

1294
01:35:51,991 --> 01:35:53,783
Stupid.

1295
01:35:53,867 --> 01:35:57,079
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid!

1296
01:35:58,873 --> 01:36:00,458
Stupid!

1297
01:36:00,541 --> 01:36:01,500
Aah!

1298
01:36:01,542 --> 01:36:03,794
What more can I do?

1299
01:36:19,643 --> 01:36:21,395
It's okay.

1300
01:36:22,521 --> 01:36:24,940
It's not your fault.

1301
01:36:45,544 --> 01:36:46,879
<i>Babbo.</i>

1302
01:37:00,601 --> 01:37:03,395
I want to ask your permission
to marry your daughter.

1303
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:10,111
It's nice,
but it's out of the question.

1304
01:37:10,194 --> 01:37:12,696
I have come here
to ask your permission

1305
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:14,073
to marry your daughter.

1306
01:37:14,156 --> 01:37:17,743
I will love her forever, and I
know that I will make her happy.

1307
01:37:17,827 --> 01:37:19,161
All young men say this.

1308
01:37:19,245 --> 01:37:21,205
Sometimes it's true.

1309
01:37:21,288 --> 01:37:22,331
Never.

1310
01:37:22,415 --> 01:37:24,667
Never?
What about you two?

1311
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:28,044
Don't be ridiculous.
I hate him half of the time.

1312
01:37:29,547 --> 01:37:34,260
Placido, don't you want
Chiara to be happy in love?

1313
01:37:34,301 --> 01:37:36,053
Happy.

1314
01:37:36,137 --> 01:37:38,055
Happy is about a lot of things.

1315
01:37:38,097 --> 01:37:40,307
It's not just
about young passion.

1316
01:37:40,391 --> 01:37:43,227
This doesn't last, Chiara,
and when it's over,

1317
01:37:43,269 --> 01:37:45,604
what you will have left
is nothing.

1318
01:37:45,646 --> 01:37:47,565
He has nothing to offer you.

1319
01:37:47,606 --> 01:37:50,859
I have everything to offer her.

1320
01:37:51,985 --> 01:37:53,362
Everything.

1321
01:37:53,446 --> 01:37:56,866
Pawel, let's go.

1322
01:37:57,908 --> 01:37:58,784
Chiara!

1323
01:37:58,868 --> 01:38:00,369
Wait. Wait.

1324
01:38:03,456 --> 01:38:05,249
Won't you give your blessing?

1325
01:38:05,291 --> 01:38:07,918
What if this is it?

1326
01:38:08,002 --> 01:38:09,712
The real thing.

1327
01:38:11,005 --> 01:38:12,465
A love that lasts forever.

1328
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:15,216
What you describe
is all in fairy tales.

1329
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,510
No, it's not.

1330
01:38:16,594 --> 01:38:20,097
And how do you know?
From personal experience?

1331
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:26,937
No, I looked for it,
and I didn't find it.

1332
01:38:27,813 --> 01:38:30,232
But that doesn't mean
it doesn't exist.

1333
01:38:30,316 --> 01:38:32,485
That's exactly what it means.

1334
01:38:32,568 --> 01:38:34,695
No one has had it.

1335
01:38:34,779 --> 01:38:37,280
I did!
I had a great love.

1336
01:38:37,364 --> 01:38:38,656
<i>Mamma!</i>

1337
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:41,160
Your father...
a great love.

1338
01:38:41,243 --> 01:38:43,204
And I'll never forget it.

1339
01:38:43,287 --> 01:38:44,955
<i>Mamma! Mamma!</i>

1340
01:38:44,997 --> 01:38:48,125
He's a poor Polish laborer.

1341
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,668
He is nobody.

1342
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:52,296
He has no family!

1343
01:38:53,798 --> 01:38:55,466
That's not true.

1344
01:39:00,887 --> 01:39:02,514
He has me.

1345
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:06,685
I'm his family.

1346
01:39:08,687 --> 01:39:10,773
I'm his family.

1347
01:39:33,671 --> 01:39:35,756
Chiara.

1348
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:00,948
Pawel.

1349
01:40:15,755 --> 01:40:18,007
Amen.

1350
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:20,342
Amen.

1351
01:40:22,386 --> 01:40:23,929
Amen.

1352
01:40:31,103 --> 01:40:32,480
Amen.

1353
01:40:47,495 --> 01:40:49,830
Okay, yes.
Okay.

1354
01:41:10,643 --> 01:41:12,311
<i>Mamma!</i>

1355
01:41:33,833 --> 01:41:35,960
What are you thinking?

1356
01:41:36,001 --> 01:41:37,586
What do I think?

1357
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:39,046
Tell me.

1358
01:41:41,048 --> 01:41:43,800
I think you got your wish.

1359
01:41:43,842 --> 01:41:45,969
My wish?

1360
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:48,222
That day we looked
for your snake

1361
01:41:48,305 --> 01:41:51,684
you said to me that you wanted
there to be a wedding here.

1362
01:42:00,401 --> 01:42:02,027
Yeah.

1363
01:42:02,153 --> 01:42:05,156
And you said you wanted there
to be a family here.

1364
01:42:12,163 --> 01:42:13,748
You're right.

1365
01:42:15,207 --> 01:42:17,043
I got my wish.

1366
01:42:18,502 --> 01:42:20,838
I got everything
that I asked for.

1367
01:42:47,448 --> 01:42:49,241
<i>Mi scusi.</i>

1368
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:58,209
You are looking for the American
writer who lives here,

1369
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:00,378
and you found her.

1370
01:43:01,462 --> 01:43:04,256
If you don't mind, I'll just...

1371
01:43:06,759 --> 01:43:07,593
There.

1372
01:43:07,635 --> 01:43:11,180
It was crawling on you.

1373
01:43:11,263 --> 01:43:12,723
A ladybug.

1374
01:43:12,765 --> 01:43:14,016
Huh.

1375
01:43:18,770 --> 01:43:22,733
Do I know you?

1376
01:43:22,775 --> 01:43:24,402
Not really.

1377
01:43:24,443 --> 01:43:26,362
You reviewed
one of my books once.

1378
01:43:26,445 --> 01:43:28,322
Did I like it?

1379
01:43:28,406 --> 01:43:29,448
Not very much.

1380
01:43:29,532 --> 01:43:31,450
- Oh, no.
- Don't worry.

1381
01:43:31,534 --> 01:43:36,580
It was, by far, the very best
bad review I've ever received.

1382
01:43:36,664 --> 01:43:37,540
You're kidding.

1383
01:43:37,623 --> 01:43:38,541
I'm not.

1384
01:43:38,624 --> 01:43:42,252
It helped me get to
my next book.

1385
01:43:42,335 --> 01:43:46,090
Anyway, I've been traveling
around Tuscany.

1386
01:43:46,132 --> 01:43:48,843
Someone said that
you lived up here.

1387
01:43:52,096 --> 01:43:53,472
I'm Ed.

1388
01:43:53,514 --> 01:43:54,598
Hi.

1389
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:55,433
Hi.

1390
01:43:55,474 --> 01:43:57,101
Hi.

1391
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:59,353
I'm Frances.

1392
01:43:59,437 --> 01:44:00,104
Hi.

1393
01:44:00,187 --> 01:44:01,439
Hi.

1394
01:44:02,189 --> 01:44:05,442
There's a wedding going on.
This isn't your wedding.

1395
01:44:05,483 --> 01:44:08,571
That would be unfortunate.

1396
01:44:26,337 --> 01:44:29,967
<i>They say they built
the train tracks over the Alps</i>

1397
01:44:30,051 --> 01:44:33,387
<i>before there was a train
that could make the trip.</i>

1398
01:44:33,471 --> 01:44:35,222
<i>They built it anyway.</i>

1399
01:44:35,306 --> 01:44:38,017
<i>They knew one day
the train would come.</i>

1400
01:44:40,144 --> 01:44:43,022
<i>Any arbitrary turning
along the way,</i>

1401
01:44:43,064 --> 01:44:44,857
<i>and I would be elsewhere.</i>

1402
01:44:44,899 --> 01:44:46,817
<i>I would be different.</i>

1403
01:44:48,861 --> 01:44:51,279
<i>What are four walls, anyway?</i>

1404
01:44:51,362 --> 01:44:53,239
<i>They are what they contain.</i>

1405
01:44:53,324 --> 01:44:56,077
<i>The house protects the dreamer.</i>

1406
01:44:56,160 --> 01:45:00,539
<i>Unthinkably good things can
happen, even late in the game.</i>

1407
01:45:00,623 --> 01:45:02,875
<i>It's such a surprise.</i>
