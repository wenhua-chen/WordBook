- Everyone loves Tour de France.
- Exactly!

- Now we're talking.

- OK...
- Alright...

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,000
- Can you just give us a moment, please?
- You got this?

50
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't suppose we'll get
a lot of money off her.

51
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,500
- I ain't got time, Georgie.
- OK.

52
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:32,583
- 60 each.
- Nah.

53
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,417
Right, you know what,
let's just take 'em somewhere else.

54

Alright, see ya later.
See yourself out. Close the door.

Please, Zeph?
You know I need the money.

56
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,042
I'm Zeph.

57
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,250
This is my shop.

58
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,417
This is my van.

59
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:54,625
What I would say to Georgie,
the advice I'd give to her, is...

60
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,958
...it's... it all goes...
it goes like that.

61
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,000
Like a... a circle.

62
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,833
So, you're born and
then everyone... everyone dies.

63
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,208
But hopefully, she doesn't die soon,
cos she's a child.

64
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,917
Yeah, Georgie's
a very nice person really.

65
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:15,875
You keep chatting rubbish.
She's not a good person.

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,500
- She keeps stealing our bikes.
- Yeah, but not mine.

67
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,958
We don't like her.

68
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,125
She doesn't even know
how to apply foundation.

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,167
An entire day off?

70
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:30,042
It just doesn't take an entire day off
to grieve, it just doesn't.

71
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:32,083
I'm sorry, it doesn't.

72
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,708
You know, a morning off.
A morning off, that's all it takes.

73
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:39,542
Take a morning off, come back,
get over it.

74
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,125
Obviously, very sad.

75
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,500
- Extremely.
- So... sad.

76
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,875
Lovely though that she's living with...

77
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,458
Er... her uncle.

78
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,125
Winston Churchill.

79
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,042
Disgusting.

80
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,042
Absolutely disgusting!

81
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,708
Ah, beautiful.

82
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,750
Josh, could you do me one favour?

83
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:40,250
- No more voice recordings.
- Ah, but you're so good at 'em.

84
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,708
What do you want me to say?

85
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,583
"Georgie is doing great at school,
thanks."

86
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,500
Georgie's doing great at school, thanks.

87
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,500
Say it like you mean it, then.

88
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,833
Let's try that again.

89
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,375
Georgie's doing great
at school, thanks.

90
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,167
Ah, that's actually...
Ah, that's amazing.

91
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,250
That was so good.

92
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:13,375
Um... "We are thinking
of getting a hamster."

93
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,500
We're thinking of getting a hamster.

94
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,583
'A hamster? I mean
great, yeah. Good for you, good for you.

95
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,958
'How's Georgie getting on?'

96
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:30,292
- 'We are fine, thank you.'
- 'That's good, good.

97
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:33,417
'Emotionally coping with the situation?'

98
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:36,458
'We are eating
spaghetti bolognese today.'

99
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,833
'I find that
cheers me up, yeah.

100
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,000
'Both big fans of the bolognese.
I don't blame you. It is delicious.

101
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,917
'Maybe Georgie can tell me a little bit
more about how she's getting on.

102
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:51,042
- 'Would she be free for a little chat?'
- Hello!

103
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,667
'Hiya! How you getting on?'

104
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:56,542
Good. I'm very busy at the minute,
so I've got to go.

105
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,125
'OK, well, have a nice tea!

106
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,958
'Winston?'

107
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,500
- 'We are fine, thank you.'
- 'Er, OK. Great.

108
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:09,083
'Well...
I, for one, feel reassured.'

109
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,917
Mum!

110
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,875
Mum!

111
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,458
Georgie!
Hey, I'll call you back.

112
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,750
Can Ali stay tonight?

113
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,875
- OK. Are you gonna be in bed by ten?
- Before ten!

114
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,042
OK, good. Does your uncle not mind?

115
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:17,042
- He doesn't mind.
- I would really like to meet your uncle.

116
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:19,958
Yeah, my uncle's really busy
at the minute.

117
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,583
- Busy?
- Yeah.

118
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,958
OK, but how are you coping?

119
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,583
Dance.

120
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,000
Mum, do you wanna see our dance?

121
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,000
- OK, show me the dance.
- Alright.

122
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,542
To the left.

123
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,833
Good moves, kids. Good moves.

124
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:47,333
- It's purple.
- It's not.

125
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,917
- It's literally purple.
- It's not.

126
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:54,042
- What colour is it, then?
- Pink.

127
00:10:58,542 --> 00:10:59,958
Get up.

128
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,000
Amazing!

129
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,375
Leave them how they were!

130
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,333
- It ain't comfy like that.
- Well, that's how Mum did it.

131
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,292
- Doesn't always have to be the same.
- Yes, it does.

132
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,000
Move your feet!

133
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,875
- What do you wanna watch?
- Er...

134
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,667
- No.
- Why not?

135
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:12,250
Not again.

136
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,750
I'm sick of not being able
to vacuum up them spiders and all.

137
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,583
How could you even consider
killing Napoleon?

138
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,583
You know that's my guy from day.
Always got my back!

139
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,833
Genghis, a bit of a mad guy,
but still my G!

140
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,833
Julius and Maggie T,
those two little love birds.

141
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,875
Disgusting, bruv!

142
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:43,042
And Alexander the Great.

143
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:51,417
RIP, my certy guy.
What a devastating blow.

144
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:54,667
Please stop talking about it.
Very annoying.

145
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,083
Agh!

146
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,750
Can you get your stinky feet
out of my face?

147
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,167
What stage of grief are you at now?

148
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,667
I think I'm almost finished.
Stage three or four?

149
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:24,042
But I'll get through
the other stages quick.

150
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,458
But you literally had a go at me
for moving the pillows.

151
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,458
Everything's still the same
as how your mum did it, you know?

152
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:36,417
Mum...

153
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:41,292
She said she was going up into the sky.

154
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:45,042
What?
Like to real heaven and that?

155
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,083
Like, proper proper?

156
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,167
Dunno.

157
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,458
What were you doing in that room again
before I came?

158
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,042
Um... playing.

159
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,708
I could play, too, if you want.
Only if you want company, though.

160
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,042
No.

161
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,000
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

162
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:11,000
- Goodnight, Georgie.
- Shut up!

163
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,250
Nah, nah,
Stace, hear, man.

164
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,708
He's just not hubby material,
I'm telling you.

165
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,167
The other day he was like to me,
"Ah, I think you're the one."

166
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:51,042
Me? Girl, bye...

167
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,375
'Why are you filming me?

168
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,833
'Georgie, please get that camera
out of my face!

169
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,375
- 'What is wrong with you? Turn it round.'
- 'Nah!'

170
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,083
- 'That day five of those pyjamas?'
- 'What was that?'

171
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,042
- 'Day five with no shower?'
- 'Huh?'

172
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,583
- 'Can smell you a mile off!'
- 'Excuse me!

173
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,875
'Shall we tell the camera
what I've just pulled out of your hair?

174
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,750
'Shall we tell them?
A nice big juicy nit!'

175
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,833
'I probably got them from you,
anyway.'

176
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,708
'No, you didn't!

177
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,167
'Get it out, please. You're grounded.'

178
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,375
Hello, hello, hello
and welcome to...

179
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,458
Crusty Musty, um...
Helping Hand Lip Show.

180
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,792
Today, we are selling
this red lipstick palette.

181
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,333
Now, here we have Clive.

182
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,417
As you can see,
Clive's lips are very crusty.

183
00:15:57,542 --> 00:16:01,375
- Just like the gentleman in the studio.
- Just shut up! Shut up!

184
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,708
We have lots of callers on the phone
at the minute.

185
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,833
- What's this made out of?
- Um...

186
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,958
Endangered, um, shredded lizards

187
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,167
and crushed-up ruby diamonds.

188
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:17,875
Now, we are looking
for a low-low price of £2 million...

189
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,625
How much?

190
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,250
I think you heard me, sir.

191
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,208
- Now, we have lots and lots...
- Wait, who's that?

192
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,917
What you doing in my garden?

193
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,250
- Alright, kids?
- No, we ain't.

194
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,917
Are you Georgie?

195
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,208
Who's asking?

196
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm Jason.

197
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,250
I'm your dad.

198
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,500
Owner of that top.

199
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,917
No, you ain't. My mum give me this.

200
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,958
Yeah, I gave it to her.

201
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:11,667
- What, you living on your own, then?
- No.

202
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,167
- Can I come in for a chat?
- Get out!

203
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,042
Right, so I'll tell the Social there's
a 12-year-old living on her own, shall I?

204
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,292
You let him in.

205
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:40,583
What do you expect me to do?
He was gonna call the Social on me.

206
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,208
Yeah, but...

207
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:44,583
Exactly.

208
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,458
How are you gonna sleep at night knowing
that he's lurking around the house?

209
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,458
Shall we have dinner later?

210
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,792
David Beckham's welcome as well.

211
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:53,917
No.

212
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:56,333
Don't be like that. It's free food.

213
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,625
Free food?

214
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:02,042
Are you serious?
Can you stop thinking about the food?

215
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:05,167
He could be using it
to blackmail us or something.

216
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,625
- Or trying to poison us.
- Exactly.

217
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,833
Yeah, you seriously can't trust him,
though.

218
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,542
- I got an idea.
- Hm?

219
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:19,458
Can you go and get us a Chinese then
from the place down the street?

220
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,625
- It's our favourite.
- Yeah, yeah.

221
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,792
- We're gonna go out and play.
- Right.

222
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:26,667
- Can you make sure you're back for six?
- Whatever.

223
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,625
Who's David Beckham?

224
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,875
What we're gonna do,
he's gonna go out and get the Chinese,

225
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and we're gonna be waiting
somewhere nearby.

226
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,625
We'll bolt the door from the inside
and then we'll climb out.

227
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,083
And then we won't let him back in.

228
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:45,292
Yeah, and we'll chuck his stuff
out the window, right?

229
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:50,792
Well, if it's worth anything,
we'll consider keeping it, OK?

230
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,417
Yeah, I guess.

231
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:54,417
OK, so hear me out on this one, yeah?

232
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:57,167
Can you make a werewolf
and a vampire hybrid?

233
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,542
Right, so let's say I've got a vampire
and I get the vampire blood,

234
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,333
and I get a werewolf
and I get the werewolf blood,

235
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,667
and you get them together and you start
mixing them, take them to a science lab,

236
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:05,333
put them in a science beaker thing,

237
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,875
put them in a box
and leave it for ten years to freeze.

238
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,458
And once you come back
after ten years,

239
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,458
there's a werewolf
and vampire hybrid baby!

240
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,833
That's actually so stupid.

241
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,458
I can't believe... Oh, my gosh.

242
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,833
I thought you were smarter than that.

243
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,500
Well, Jason can't be a vampire, right?

244
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,958
Cos your mum was mad superstitious
with garlic and that at the front door.

245
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:37,333
No, he's not a vampire.
That's just stupid.

246
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,250
Maybe he might, like,
start growing uncontrollably at night,

247
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,833
come into our rooms
and start sucking our neck!

248
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,708
Nah, that's a bit weird.

249
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:47,667
Maybe he was in prison.

250
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,042
What if he's a big-time gangster?

251
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,875
They're both proper weirdos.
Who breaks into their own house?

252
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:23,500
- Chicken and sweetcorn.
- Yeah, no, no, in the sandwiches.

253
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,417
- Oh!
- And in the pies.

254
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:26,542
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,667
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- But the gravy is kind of, er...

256
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:32,292
- Yeah, the gravy's a bit too thick.
- Bit too thick.

257
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,958
The rest of it, though. Banging.

258
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,833
All my money for them. Lovely.

259
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:41,042
- Well, actually, you paid for me, innit?
- Yeah, exactly.

260
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,417
- Be grateful.
- Such a kind friend you are.

261
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:46,375
- Yeah, I know. I am.
- Yeah!

262
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,250
- Sign's gone!
- Alright, bye.

263
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,750
Bit cold now, this Chinese.

264
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,625
It's ungrateful as well, ain't it, really?

265
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,083
If someone's buying food for you
and your little mate,

266
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,167
just to throw it back in my face
like that.

267
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,708
- Get your feet off the table.
- Or what?

268
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:20,583
- Sure you don't want a little bit?
- No, I don't.

269
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,000
- Can't stay for long.
- I'll stay as long as I want.

270
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,750
It's my house.

271
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,667
Hm, I was here before you, though,
weren't I?

272
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:37,833
- I pay the rent.
- Hm.

273
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,000
See how long that lasts.

274
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,375
Agh!
Stupid thing!

275
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,333
- What you done to it?
- Nothing.

276
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,500
I just put it on like normal
and it started flooding out everywhere.

277
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,750
Who even said that you could use
the bloomin' washing machine?

278
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,083
- I did. Watch your tone!
- Watch yours!

279
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,583
- Either get out or help!
- Oh, God!

280
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:52,167
Right, come on, get that in the wash.
You've been wearing it since I got here.

281
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:54,583
- No!
- Come on, it stinks.

282
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,417
If I have to.

283
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:04,792
That is mad comfy in there!

284
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:12,875
Obviously, though,
you share, like, apartments, innit?

285
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,667
There's probably, like, four or five of us.

286
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:17,542
Share a kitchen, got a nice little pool.

287
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,833
- You're living with your boys?
- Yeah, it's sick.

288
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,208
Go on.

289
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,792
That was sick!

290
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:27,333
That was sick.

291
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,500
- Do you speak Spanish, then?
- Mm-hm.

292
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:36,167
Yeah, a little bit.
Understand most of it.

293
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:38,333
- Is it better over there?
- Yeah.

294
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,792
Yeah, it's hot. Food's better.

295
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:43,417
Beaches, girls,
you know what I'm saying?

296
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:50,667
Better than home?

297
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,750
Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,833
So, it's alright
to just leave people behind, is it?

299
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:59,792
You never thought that leaving someone
to raise a child on their own was a bit...

300
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:01,417
selfish?

301
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,958
I'm just... gonna go
on my evening walk.

302
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,167
Your mum never wanted me around,
you know?

303
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:17,542
- She said that, did she?
- I knew it.

304
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:21,125
Even so, most dads send money
every now and then.

305
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,208
Help out. We ain't exactly
been rolling in it, have we?

306
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,125
I ain't rolling in it myself, am I?

307
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,583
This job you've got, is it a normal job
for a 30-year-old man?

308
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:35,000
- Yes, there's loads of people my age...
- Then what are you here for now?

309
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,792
I told you. I heard about your mum passing
and I wanted to get to know you.

310
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:39,417
After 12 years?

311
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:42,167
How come you didn't want
to know me 12 years ago?

312
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,167
Because we were young,
like we weren't getting along.

313
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,292
- She told me to leave.
- You're a liar!

314
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:50,250
I ain't surprised no one's stuck around
for you, you know that?

315
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:57,458
Think you can just turn up with some
flowers, say you're sorry about my mum

316
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,208
and it'll all be alright?

317
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,458
It ain't.

318
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,375
Do you think he'll stay?

319
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,208
I don't care.

320
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:27,417
I think he will.

321
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:36,667
Would probably be best
if he does, right?

322
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:38,250
Why?

323
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,333
You can't...

324
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,417
You can't keep living by yourself.

325
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,958
Why can't I? I'm doing fine.

326
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,958
Not that one.

327
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:11,792
Not that one, either.

328
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,917
Put it back! Move out the way.

329
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:25,958
Here you go, nice simple mug for ya.

330
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,875
Alright, cheers.

331
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,833
Uh! That's off!

332
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:37,417
- Do you want anything from the shop?
- No.

333
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,792
Don't move.

334
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:45,208
Hello?

335
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,042
Oh, hello, Sian.

336
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:52,917
Yeah, no, I've got a cold at the minute
so my voice is a bit... tickly.

337
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:54,292
Yeah.

338
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,583
Georgie's doing alright, yeah.
Aren't you, Georgie?

339
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,458
Yeah, she's good.

340
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,292
Yeah, no, we're just having
a nice breakfast together, actually.

341
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,583
Alright, well,
thanks for checking in.

342
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,000
Actually, Sian, should I, er...

343
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,167
Should I give you my new mobile number
in case you need anything?

344
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,875
Yeah, it's 07984.

345
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,708
639.

346
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,042
364.

347
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:25,375
Cheers, Sian.

348
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,375
Alright.

349
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:33,917
I'll have to meet this
Uncle Winston Churchill at some point.

350
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:38,917
Remember, I can tell the Social whenever
I want, so drop the attitude, yeah?

351
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:41,917
Yeah?

352
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:45,625
Back in a bit.

353
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,875
New milk.

354
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,250
How was your porridge?

355
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:48,917
What's that job you said you did again?

356
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:52,750
Ticket selling in Ibiza.

357
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,125
Right.

358
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,083
Is there any, like...

359
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,917
...dangers in Ibiza?

360
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,625
Not really, no.

361
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:12,083
Alright. I'm off to work.

362
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,458
"Ticket sales.

363
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:23,292
"A representative
or a rep for a nightclub

364
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:26,375
"who sells tickets to holidaymakers."

365
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:30,042
Maybe it's slang
for something?

366
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:35,125
- You think he's planning to kill you?
- I don't think so.

367
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,583
Why wouldn't he have done it already?
Bit stupid not to.

368
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:43,208
Likes to toy with his prey?

369
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,625
You gotta scratch the serial numbers off.

370
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,750
- What?
- You gotta get the serial numbers off.

371
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:21,500
Otherwise the police will track them
back to the bikes that've been nicked.

372
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,042
Look.

373
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:27,458
Feel.

374
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,583
Even when you paint 'em,
you can still feel 'em.

375
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:38,042
Look, scratch 'em off.

376
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:40,667
- Oh, yeah!
- Then they won't get tracked back.

377
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,958
Yeah? Go on, give that a go, bruv.

378
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:48,792
Who says the bikes are stolen?

379
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,500
Ali. Ali.

380
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,875
Ali!

381
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:07,875
- We need to check his phone.
- What?

382
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,458
Jason, we need to check his phone.

383
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:12,125
Come on.

384
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:24,458
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

385
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,417
It's nothing mad.

386
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:07,500
You can take it back now, you know.

387
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,167
Look.

388
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,667
It's not like you're naked
in the bath, is it?

389
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,917
What do you think you're doing?

390
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:21,708
- Just...
- You just what?

391
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:24,500
You think you can go through my stuff?
You don't do that!

392
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:27,583
- What's on your phone?
- That's nothing to do with you.

393
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,250
You don't even know me.

394
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:33,417
What you doing here again?
You not got your own home?

395
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:35,292
I'll leave if you want me to.

396
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:42,208
- Whatever.
- Right, shut up now!

397
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:25,125
'Georgie, please get that camera
out of my face!

398
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,792
- 'What is wrong with you? Turn it round.'
- 'Nah!'

399
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,583
- 'That day five of those pyjamas?'
- 'What was that?'

400
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,375
- 'Day five with no shower?'
- 'Huh?'

401
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,625
- 'Can smell you a mile off!'
- 'Excuse me!

402
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,958
'Shall we tell the camera
what I've just pulled out of your hair?

403
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,750
'Shall we tell them?
A nice big juicy nit!'

404
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:43,208
'I probably got them from you,
anyway.'

405
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:46,000
'No, you didn't!

406
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,792
'Get it out, please. You're grounded.'

407
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,083
Well, he's obviously hiding
something.

408
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,833
No, he ain't.

409
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,292
Did you see how he reacted?

410
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:13,417
Well, maybe he just wants some privacy,
like you do.

411
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:15,875
Oh, don't be stupid, Ali.

412
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,875
What is wrong with you?
Everyone's out to get you, ain't they?

413
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,792
The world revolves around Georgie.
You can trust people, you know.

414
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:25,250
He's being nice.
At least he's here now.

415
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,833
What are you being
such a little victim for, you idiot?

416
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:32,875
Ever since he got here,
you've just been a beg friend to him.

417
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,458
I'm meant to be your mate.

418
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,417
You can have more than one mate,
you know.

419
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:41,458
Go on, then, go and be his mate.
I don't need you anymore.

420
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:45,042
- I will.
- Good.

421
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:47,208
Go. I've got other mates.

422
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,542
Absolutely not!

423
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,375
Oh, God!

424
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,250
What, a friend?

425
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:57,583
What, me and her?
Nah, man. She's a little girl.

426
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,708
More of an acquaintance, really.

427
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:02,708
- Wouldn't you say?
- Distant acquaintance.

428
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:05,042
She just doesn't deserve
to be my friend.

429
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,750
- You alright, Georgie?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

430
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,500
- You alright?
- Mm-hm.

431
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,042
Do you want a... want a hug or...?

432
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:47,958
- I'm alright, thanks.
- Yeah. Probably...

433
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,750
Here you go.

434
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,375
Alright.

435
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,542
Five quid and I'll...
I'll use it for parts.

436
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,792
- Ten.
- Five.

437
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,375
- Fine.
- Where's Ali?

438
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,750
Fell out.

439
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,667
- Can I stay in here and work with you...?
- No, not today.

440
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:19,125
- I don't wanna be paid or nothing.
- Look, just jog on, man, please.

441
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:22,500
- OK.
- Alright.

442
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,333
And I understand that she's sad.

443
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:46,792
Obviously, I get that,
but what are we meant to do?

444
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:51,083
And it's never really like this.
We fall out once a year, maybe.

445
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,333
Yeah, this time it's different.

446
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:58,000
So, how long has...
How long has it been, then? What, like...?

447
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:01,208
Probably, like, couple of hours, I think.

448
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:03,417
Yeah.

449
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:08,875
Just give it time, innit?
I don't know, just...

450
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:12,625
Yeah.

451
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,167
You alright?

452
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:24,750
I, um... I cooked, and then Ali turned up.

453
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:28,000
Something about you two having a spat.

454
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,500
Come on, sit down.

455
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,208
Go on, plonk yourself down.

456
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,833
I made some dinner, look.

457
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:43,000
- Er... It's quite spicy.
- Yeah, I know.

458
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:46,542
I put some, um, chilli powder
and tarragon in it.

459
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,167
That was all you had
in the cupboards, but...

460
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,833
I think it... I think it works.

461
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,250
Mm. How was school?

462
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,375
It's the school holidays.

463
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,292
What?

464
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:19,083
- No?
- That ain't funny!

465
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:23,000
That's not my fault.
That must've been loose already.

466
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,542
That's my mum. We're going caravan.

467
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:33,458
Yeah? Oh.

468
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,333
A-ha! Who's this?

469
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:39,042
- Jason.
- Georgie's dad.

470
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:42,292
Oh, you didn't mention he was around.

471
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:45,042
Yeah, he's here now
instead of her uncle.

472
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:47,917
Right. I don't think we have met.

473
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:50,083
No. No, we ain't. Jason. You alright?

474
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,292
- Jason?
- Mm-hm.

475
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:55,667
- I don't remember Vicky mentioning you.
- Oh, I've been working abroad.

476
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,833
- OK. Back now, then?
- For a bit. Yeah.

477
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,833
Good.

478
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:08,000
Georgie!
What happened with your tooth?

479
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:11,167
Oh, it fell out. His burnt garlic bread.

480
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:15,042
She'll be alright, it was loose anyway.
She'll be alright.

481
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:17,917
OK, get your stuff, huh?

482
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:21,125
- Alright, Jason. I'll see you again.
- Yeah.

483
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,375
- I'll be here, yeah. Nice to meet ya.
- Yeah, good. OK.

484
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,208
- Enjoy the caravan.
- It was interesting to meet you.

485
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:28,208
- Yeah, yeah. Enjoy your trip.
- Yeah, yeah.

486
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,708
- Yeah, we will, thank you.
- Yeah, yeah.

487
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:55,458
'...year guarantee. Of course, two years,
just like everything else we sell.

488
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:58,042
- 'Highly recommended.'
- 'It's a no-quibble guarantee?

489
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:00,750
'No problems at all, whatever happens,
you get your money back?'

490
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,333
'Exactly...'

491
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:44,833
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

492
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:49,083
- What you awake for?
- You nicking my money?

493
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:51,458
What? No!

494
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,667
I was looking for your tooth.

495
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:04,250
Why would I put my teeth
underneath my pillow?

496
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,667
- For the tooth fairy.
- What?

497
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,417
Put your tooth under the pillow,

498
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:13,292
then the tooth fairy gives you
a couple of quid, don't she?

499
00:43:13,417 --> 00:43:14,542
Does she?

500
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,167
Yeah.

501
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:20,792
- She's never done that before.
- Really?

502
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:24,083
She must owe me, like, 20 quid, then.

503
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:27,250
Right, well, you might as well have it
now. There you are.

504
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:33,250
- I don't want your money.
- What?

505
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,833
I don't want your money.

506
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:40,792
Alright.

507
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:53,708
You going out to work?

508
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:58,958
Without Ali?

509
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,667
Do you want me
to come give you a hand?

510
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:21,417
- Hurry up.
- Come on, do your job properly.

511
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:24,833
What? What do you think I'm doing?
I'm looking out.

512
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:26,958
- Hm?
- I'm watching, innit?

513
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,417
- What you doing, trying to pick it?
- What do you think I'm doing?

514
00:44:32,542 --> 00:44:35,208
- Get an allen key on the seat.
- Do it, then.

515
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,500
- Quickly!
- Alright.

516
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:39,000
- Calm down.
- Do you want me to do it?

517
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,208
There you go.

518
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:44,708
- You're proper longing it out, ain't ya?
- Give me the bolt cutters.

519
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,292
- I was literally just about to do that.
- No, you wasn't.

520
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,750
- Quickly.
- Yes, I was.

521
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:50,333
Bloody hell, how many tools
do you really need?

522
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:52,333
Oi!

523
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:54,792
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Oi! Come here!

524
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,417
Yeah, in pursuit now.

525
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,167
Ooh! Sorry!

526
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:19,000
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

527
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:22,500
Go down there.

528
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:28,208
- You see how slow they were!
- Shut up! It ain't funny!

529
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,625
Can you stop laughing?

530
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,750
You sound like a pig.

531
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,583
- Want a bit of water in there?
- What is it? There's all clumps in it.

532
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,708
- Huh?
- I'm trying to get the clumps out.

533
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:31,417
Well, that will help, won't it?
There you go.

534
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:34,750
No, I don't need your tea water
in my hot chocolate.

535
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:40,208
- You seen my phone?
- No.

536
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:41,708
Are you sure?

537
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,458
I haven't seen it.

538
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:54,792
Nah, don't go in my bag.

539
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,875
Get out my bag now.

540
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:04,750
Can't find it.

541
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,667
Might have fallen out your pocket
when you were running?

542
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:08,958
- Which one was it in?
- This one.

543
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,667
- Is there zips on it?
- No.

544
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:12,042
That's long gone, then.

545
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,375
That's your fault, that is.
You're the one that made us run like that.

546
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,875
- It was run or get arrested, Georgie.
- You were fiddling about with the bikes!

547
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,375
- You drew attention to us.
- No.

548
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,708
It was probably your speed
that messed us up.

549
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:47,875
'Why you filming me?'

550
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:00,875
'Why you filming me?'

551
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,250
'Why you filming me?'

552
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:09,500
What you looking for?

553
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,125
- What you looking for?
- What do you care?

554
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,042
I dunno.

555
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:23,750
- Just my phone.
- Your phone?

556
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,625
What are you so upset about that for?

557
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,417
Just ask for a new one.

558
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:31,583
- Shut up, you don't get it.
- Get what? It's just a phone!

559
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,333
- No, it's not.
- What are you being stupid for?

560
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:36,250
Shut up!

561
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:01,625
- Georgie?
- Oi!

562
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,417
- What do you think you're doing?
- Bringing you this.

563
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:11,042
What were you doing in there?
Playing secret games or something?

564
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:14,208
Don't worry.

565
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:19,083
Do you wanna go out for the day?

566
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:21,292
Come on, a little adventure! It'll be fun.

567
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
- Can't.
- Can't?

568
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:28,000
Why not, you busy?
Got big plans, have ya?

569
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:31,417
Georgie! Georgie, open up!

570
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:33,917
No, no, no, no.

571
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,625
You really hurt Layla.

572
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,125
Georgie!

573
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,542
Don't answer,
don't answer.

574
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:44,458
I know you're living here
by yourself.

575
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:50,958
Georgie!

576
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:54,083
- Don't. Please don't answer.
- Georgie, will you open this door?

577
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:56,417
- Don't answer, please.
- I'm losing my patience here.

578
00:51:58,792 --> 00:52:01,042
- Let's nip out the back.
- Come on, will you come to the door?

579
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:02,500
Get low, though. Duck down.

580
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,958
Me and your mum used
to play this game, yeah,

581
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:31,083
where you, like, pick people having
a conversation then you have it for them.

582
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:34,167
You know, make up
a little story for them?

583
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:37,417
Here you are, look.
Look at these two over here. There.

584
00:52:37,542 --> 00:52:41,917
Let's just assume they're a couple.
I'll be the guy, you be the woman, yeah?

585
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:48,625
My God!
This sandwich is bloody delightful!

586
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:55,750
- What?
- Do her.

587
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:00,292
To think it was only £10.

588
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:04,708
Well... £10 isn't much to me!

589
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,000
Pocket change, darling.

590
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:11,375
Go on.

591
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:16,792
Darling, we need to discuss
and talk about your job.

592
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:20,417
What about my job?

593
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:23,833
There's not enough money
for the plants.

594
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,750
Sandra, I'm not going through this again!

595
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:29,708
It's all getting too much!
Your spending's out of control.

596
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:32,250
- Excuse me?
- You heard me!

597
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:34,750
Patrick, I...

598
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:37,708
I've only spent £10,000
in the last month.

599
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:42,000
Last year it was the dogs and this year
it's the garden. I just can't keep up.

600
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:44,250
- Do you think I go to work every day...
- Patrick!

601
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:46,667
No, Sandra, you listen to me.

602
00:53:47,917 --> 00:53:52,667
If you really must know
why I'm spending so much on the plants,

603
00:53:52,792 --> 00:53:56,083
then... it's...

604
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:58,792
Oh, you're going to cry now, are you?

605
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:01,625
Typical! Typical Sandra!

606
00:54:03,417 --> 00:54:08,208
It's because, well,
Vera... Vera and Peter,

607
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:11,167
they keep looking over the fence,
giving dirty looks going...

608
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:13,500
- Oh!
- Every day!

609
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,542
- Again with the comparisons?
- Every day, about five times a day!

610
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:18,917
- Their garden is beautiful!
- So is ours!

611
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:22,583
They have yellow,
white and purple, pink...

612
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,167
- Ours is lovely, darling.
- ...green flowers.

613
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:28,208
- And we have nothing!
- We have everything you've ever wanted.

614
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,500
- They have a small lake!
- Oi, mate!

615
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:33,125
We can hear you, yeah?
Don't take the mick.

616
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,417
Oops.

617
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:42,333
Disgusting here, it stinks.

618
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:46,125
- It's where I grew up.
- The countryside?

619
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,833
Mm.

620
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:51,333
Right, so listen, how it works.

621
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:54,583
Hover it above the ground,
and then when the signal beeps loudest,

622
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,208
it'll be, like, "Beep!"
then you, like, know where to dig up.

623
00:54:57,333 --> 00:55:00,208
- That's where it'll be.
- Really? Oh, that's amazing, you know.

624
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:03,333
- I'd love to know more.
- Oh, yeah. OK.

625
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:05,083
Look at this. Oi!

626
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:10,167
Look at that.
I found that when I was younger.

627
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:14,625
It's in proper good nick and all.

628
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:19,292
Sick, innit?

629
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:30,208
Georgie!

630
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:32,250
- What?
- Quickly.

631
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:34,792
That's beeping like mad, go on.

632
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:36,958
- There's something there.
- Take that.

633
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:41,625
- What is it?
- A bracelet.

634
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:44,417
Yeah? Does it say anything on it?

635
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:47,958
Nah? What a coincidence!

636
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:53,333
- Happy birthday.
- It's not my birthday.

637
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:57,625
Nah, I know, but it's, like,
for the ones I've missed and that.

638
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,750
- You want me to put it on for ya?
- Mm.

639
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:16,000
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

640
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:19,792
- That looks good, that. You like it?
- Mm-hm.

641
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:23,375
Right, see, er, that's a penny.

642
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,417
Look, there's so many nice little things,
bits and bobs, that need...

643
00:56:26,542 --> 00:56:29,583
- I mean, they need a good scrub, but...
- The pennies do.

644
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:31,833
The pennies do, but sometimes...

645
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:34,667
You know, sometimes you can get
good money for them as well.

646
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,083
Yeah, that one's very dirty,
that one.

647
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:41,208
It looks like a stone, but it's not,
you can tell it's a coin.

648
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:43,000
- Yeah.
- Actually, it's a bit smaller.

649
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:45,125
It might be a stone.

650
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:48,250
Well, look, see these things here?
The brackets.

651
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,750
I'm thinking
I'll do you a nice little shelf.

652
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:56,458
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

653
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,500
There you go, keep 'em there.

654
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:02,208
Keep... Keep 'em there.
Straight.

655
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:04,708
OK, yeah?

656
00:57:11,292 --> 00:57:13,000
No, but you're cheating, though.

657
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,750
- How is that cheating?
- You've gotta keep your hand there.

658
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,750
- Wait, you're running, you're running.
- I'm not.

659
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,042
- You're running. Cheat, cheat, cheat.
- I'm just walking.

660
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:22,375
Cheat, bruv, cheat.

661
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:25,667
Alright, the dance is...

662
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:37,250
- No, you don't put the hand on your hip.
- No hand? Just...

663
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:39,958
- No! You're still putting it on your hip.
- Sorry!

664
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:41,500
- You gotta put it down the side.
- I can't help it.

665
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,667
- I can't help with the old...
- No, you...

666
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:45,125
Just keep it there.

667
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:54,167
- No, you've gotta keep bopping.
- Why have I gotta keep bopping...

668
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:56,167
- Cos you don't know how to style it out.
- ...and you stop?

669
00:57:56,292 --> 00:57:58,958
- You just stop when you want.
- No, you don't know how to style it out.

670
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:00,750
One rule for you,
different for me, innit?

671
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:02,125
No.

672
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,250
- Actually, yes.
- Yeah!

673
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,375
Do you have to do that?

674
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,500
- No.
- That's what you did.

675
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:13,042
- No, it's not. It's really not.
- It is. You went...

676
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:16,708
Like that.

677
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:21,625
That's what I done.

678
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:28,500
- You've already done it wrong.
- I got the lyrics wrong.

679
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:31,333
- Ah, the pressure! The pressure!
- Are you ready?

680
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:33,583
- Back down on your knees, come on.
- The pressure's too much!

681
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:35,875
You've gotta learn this.

682
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:38,667
Go, go. Tap.

683
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,875
OK. Tres, dos, uno...

684
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,833
♪ Rain falls

685
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,625
♪ Night time

686
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,333
♪ Inside... ♪

687
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:52,125
- That was it.
- That was shocking.

688
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,792
- Shocking?
- Yeah.

689
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:04,083
- What was your mum like?
- She's a good mum.

690
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,833
Strict at times,
but she's a good mum.

691
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,625
What was yours like?

692
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:18,625
- You knew her.
- Yeah, but, like, not as a mum.

693
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:25,833
Funny. Moany.

694
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:28,583
She definitely wouldn't have
liked metal detecting.

695
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,708
Nah, she wouldn't have.

696
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,500
Took her go-karting once for my birthday
and she... she weren't having it.

697
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:37,708
Stormed off, walked all the way home.

698
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:46,500
What was you like as a kid?
Bet you were a proper wrong'un.

699
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,958
Proper geek like metal detecting
on the regs.

700
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:53,583
No, no, no.
Nah, I was proper cool.

701
00:59:56,917 --> 00:59:58,750
You don't look very cool.

702
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:05,000
Bet you was proper full of yourself,
spoilt brat with loads of annoying mates.

703
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:19,375
It's the Social.

704
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,458
Don't answer.

705
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:23,625
I recognise their number.

706
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,375
Decline it.

707
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:38,292
Hey!

708
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:41,375
There y'are, look.
Didn't have a lighter.

709
01:00:42,292 --> 01:00:45,208
- Thought you were going a wee.
- I did both.

710
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:47,125
- Wash your hands?
- Yes.

711
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:49,167
- Soap, the whole shebang?
- Mm-hm.

712
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:53,500
- Wanna blow them out?
- There's nothing to...

713
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:56,542
I know.
Just do like a little pretend like...

714
01:00:56,667 --> 01:00:59,458
- You're not going to sing or...?
- No.

715
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,667
That's it. You missed one.

716
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:06,667
That's it.
You wanna make a wish?

717
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,125
OK.

718
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,625
- What d'you wish for?
- I'm not gonna tell you, am I?

719
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,875
Club doors are open.
Club doors shut.

720
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,875
Someone's gone out for a fag.

721
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:36,500
How do I...?
How do I do that one?

722
01:01:36,625 --> 01:01:40,417
- You just open and shut doors?
- What, continuously or...?

723
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:49,292
See you in a bit.

724
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,042
Alright.

725
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:29,208
- You alright?
- Sit down a minute.

726
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:33,333
- What, here?
- Mm-hm.

727
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:44,417
You know earlier?

728
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:48,708
- When I said I fell?
- Yeah.

729
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:54,833
- I didn't.
- Well, yeah.

730
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:57,042
I knew that.

731
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,625
I got into a fight with this girl.

732
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:07,083
Beat her up.

733
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:09,875
And her parents know it was me.

734
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,417
Are you angry at me?

735
01:03:17,917 --> 01:03:20,292
- No.
- Promise?

736
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:25,125
- I promise.
- What if I'm in proper trouble?

737
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,417
What if they call the police
or my school?

738
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,583
- I'll sort it.
- How?

739
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,208
Don't worry.

740
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:42,125
Let me sort it.

741
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:12,583
- Yeah?
- You alright? Er, sorry to bother ya.

742
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:15,333
- I'm Georgie's dad, Jason.
- Oh, you're Georgie's dad?

743
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:19,042
- Yeah, yeah. How's your girl doing?
- Have you seen what your kid's done?

744
01:04:20,167 --> 01:04:21,667
Layla?

745
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,750
Look at her face.
She's proper shaken-up.

746
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:28,167
Ah, she'll be alright.
Kids will be kids, won't they?

747
01:04:28,292 --> 01:04:31,542
Get back inside. That's no excuse.
You need to check your kid.

748
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:37,583
OK. Listen, I just came
to give you that and say sorry.

749
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:41,167
You think
that's the right thing to do?

750
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:45,375
- Have you even asked her why she did it?
- She's fine. She had a moment.

751
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,250
She definitely ain't fine.

752
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:51,000
Right.

753
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:53,750
I hope she's alright.

754
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:12,000
Did you go out last night?

755
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:15,792
Where'd you go?

756
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:18,583
Oh, I'm jealous!

757
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,708
Ah, it's rainy and grim.

758
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,333
Yeah, was it a mad night, yeah?

759
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:34,625
Did he? Ah, swear down,
he's such a mess!

760
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:29,208
'Jason, I have been
calling you for weeks.

761
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:31,500
'I know this is still your number.

762
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:37,125
'Same old selfish Jay,
running away from his responsibilities.

763
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:41,083
'The doctor said I've got weeks.

764
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:46,625
'I can't leave my Georgie on her own.

765
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:50,708
'You're the only person I can ask.

766
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:54,083
'You're the only person
who might love her like I do.

767
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:03,833
'Georgie is... Georgie.

768
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:08,833
'I've had to tell her
I'm going up to the sky, but...

769

'...she's not stupid enough
to believe that.

770

'I just don't really know
what else to say.'

771
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:17,458
- Was that actually me?
- I think so, yeah.

772
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:18,583
Yeah, I think so.

773

Why did you leave?

812
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:30,125
Look, I wanted to tell you the truth
about the voicemail.

813
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:32,625
But I just...

814
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:35,542
I couldn't face it.

815
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:43,333
Listen, what you gotta understand
about me and your mum

816
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:46,167
is that we were so young
when we had you.

817
01:14:46,292 --> 01:14:48,417
Like we were kids, it was a mess.

818
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:53,417
But you didn't even try.

819
01:14:55,042 --> 01:14:57,500
- Why didn't you try?
- I did try.

820
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,917
I promise I tried,
I'm just not good at it.

821
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:10,792
Didn't get very far.

822
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:16,292
No, I know.

823
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:20,292
I know, I didn't want to.

824
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:29,750
I don't know, I feel like
you don't need me, you know?

825
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:36,583
I didn't think I needed you.

826
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,750
Do you then, or...?

827
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:48,000
Now that I know you,
I can't really not know you.

828
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:56,750
I don't need you to replace Mum.

829
01:15:57,875 --> 01:15:59,208
But I need someone.

830
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:12,833
OK.

831
01:16:14,625 --> 01:16:15,708
Yeah, deal.

832
01:16:19,083 --> 01:16:20,875
I'm gonna mess up a lot, though.

833
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:24,667
So will I.

834
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:26,875
OK.

835
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:39,125
So... does this mean I have to, like,
change your nappies and that?

836
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,500
You did try to steal my tooth.

837
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:44,583
- Bit strange, don't you think?
- Hm.

838
01:16:50,417 --> 01:16:52,708
Shall we have a cuddle then, or...?

839
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:54,583
I don't know.

840
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:04,083
Proper one. You're not hugging me!

841
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:05,958
Why are you not hugging me properly?

842
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:09,750
What's that? That's not a...

843
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:19,042
- You wanna hold hands?
- I'm good, thanks.

844
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,292
Fair enough.

845
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:22,417
You need to start cleaning up
after yourself.

846
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:24,292
I'm fed up of cleaning up for ya.

847
01:17:24,417 --> 01:17:26,542
- I am cleaning up after me.
- Like I'm the adult and you're the kid.

848
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:28,083
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

849
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,625
- I've been cleaning up.
- No, you haven't.

850
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:32,250
- What have I been leaving out?
- You left your onion rings on the table.

851
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:37,375
You haven't washed up your dishes.
You're taking my old bedsheets.

852
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,292
- Yeah, but I'm washing them after.
- No, you're not washing 'em.

853
01:17:40,417 --> 01:17:43,083
- I'm washing 'em!
- I will wash 'em after!

854
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:44,667
It doesn't matter, does it?

855
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:48,458
- The paperwork was a nightmare.
- Always is.

856
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:51,667
It's a real shame.
She was on a good path.

857
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,792
So rude, the pair of them,
and when they're together, it's worse.

858
01:17:54,917 --> 01:17:56,083
It's the worst!

859
01:17:56,208 --> 01:17:59,333
Now she's just got a dad. It's, like...
Hooray!

860
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:02,458
- We've all got dads.
- I haven't got a dad.

861
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:08,000
The black eye got me two weeks
off school. Which was cool.

862
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:11,917
Georgie brought me a cake
to say sorry and that.

863
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:15,125
She's turning up.
At least there's that, you know.

864
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:19,250
She's here, about as much
as you can ask for with a kid like that.

865
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:20,458
So...

866
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:23,583
Well done!
Well done, you.

867
01:18:23,708 --> 01:18:25,875
Amazing stuff.

868
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:29,375
That idiot Jason, he took my bike.

869
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,167
He said he was going to nick it
and it's been two weeks now.

870
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:34,583
- And he still hasn't given it back.
- Calm down.

871
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:36,458
And him? Oh, my days!

872
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:39,667
That hair! What is that hair?
He thinks he's in "8 Mile".

873
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:45,167
Don't be in a mood with me.

874
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:47,000
Well, you didn't let me
choose a thing.

875
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:49,667
You've got really bad taste,
you know.

876
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:52,875
You can't paint a bloody living room
midnight blue.

877
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,375
Well, he disagreed,
the man in the shop.

878
01:18:56,417 --> 01:18:58,625
The guy handing out the samples

879
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:01,542
ain't the guy to be listening to,
alright?

880
01:19:01,667 --> 01:19:03,875
I've already said
you can paint the bathroom

881
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,542
- cos no one sees that so it don't matter.
- Oh, shut up!

882
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:11,000
Yeah!
The colour looks good, you know.

883
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:13,583
- I told you.
- Yeah, it looks decent.

884
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,625
Oh, gotcha.

885
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:20,917
It's a bit hard work this, eh?

886
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:25,458
What you looking at?

887
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:28,000
I just think maybe
I should get a roller on it.

888
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:30,125
It's quicker the way you're doing it.

889
01:19:31,792 --> 01:19:33,833
I'm gonna be here for ages.

890
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:39,333
- You disgust me sometimes.
- I disgust you?

891
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,542
- Yeah, with your language.
- What did I say?

892
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:45,375
- Your fall language.
- What did I...? My 'fall' language?

893
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,250
Yes.

894
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:49,792

There's a bloody gate there!

897
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,458
Yes, boss. Big man.
I like the trackies.

898
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:01,917
- Very, er...
- Disgusting.

899
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:04,708
It's like... it's like... very formal.

900
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:09,042
- My mum made it for me.
- Where you going, to a bloody wedding?

901
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:11,583
- Mum made you both something.
- It is a bit wedding vibes.
