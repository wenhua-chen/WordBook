00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,651
the entire student body will be present.

357
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,278
There will be no classes, no activities.

358
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:10,867
Nothing will transpire at this institution
until that proceeding is concluded.

359
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,373
And if, at that time,
we are no further along than we are now,

360
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,293
I will expel you both.

361
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,546
(CLEARING THROAT)

362
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:28,260
Mr. Willis, would you excuse us?

363
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,349
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

364
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,769
Thank you. You, too, Mr. Willis.

365
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:39,146
I will.

366
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:46,820
(DOOR CLOSES)

367
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,196
Mr. Simms,

368
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,868
I'm not quite through with you yet.

369
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,379
One of the few perks of this office is that

370
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:09,593
I am empowered to handle certain matters
on my own as I see fit.

371
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:13,096
Do you understand?

372
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,764
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

373
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:18,351
The Dean of Admissions at Harvard
and I have an arrangement.

374
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:21,688
Along with the usual sheaf of applicants
submitted by Baird,

375
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:26,776
of which virtually two-thirds are
guaranteed admittance,

376
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,613
I add one name,

377
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:34,826
somebody who's a standout
and yet underprivileged.

378
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:40,165
A student who cannot afford to pay
the board and tuition in Cambridge.

379
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:46,338
Do you know on whose behalf
I drafted a memo this year?

380
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:48,548
No, sir.

381
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:49,841
You.

382
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,385
You, Mr. Simms.

383
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,849
Now can you tell me who did it?

384
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,895
(SIGHS) No, sir, I can't.

385
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:06,149
You take the weekend
to think about it, Mr. Simms.

386
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,445
Good afternoon.

387
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,950
What'd he say?

388
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,535
- Nothin'.
- What do you mean, nothing?

389
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,330
He said the same thing. He just said it over.

390
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,082
You know what he's doing?

391
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,876
He's good-cop, bad-coppin' us.

392
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,629
He knows I'm old guard. You're fringe.

393
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,340
He's gonna bear down on me
and soft-soap you.

394
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,469
(LAUGHING) Did he try to soft-soap you?

395
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:35,720
Did he?

396
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:37,639
No.

397
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,935
Chas, I detect a slight panic pulse from you.
Are you panicking?

398
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,436
Yeah, a little.

399
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,689
Come on. You're on scholarship, right?

400
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:47,941
Yeah.

401
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,152
You're on scholarship from Oregon at Baird.

402
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,698
You're a long way from home, Chas.

403
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,492
What's that got to do with anything?

404
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,287
I don't know how it works out there.

405
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,955
But how it works here?

406
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,790
We stick together.

407
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:06,334
It's us against them, no matter what.

408
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,253
We don't cover our ass.

409
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:10,338
We don't tell our parents.

410
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,132
Stonewall everybody!

411
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:17,846
And above all, never, ever

412
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:21,057
leave any of us twisting in the wind.

413
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,477
And that's it.

414
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,272
What does that have to do with
me being on scholarship?

415
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,190
Hey, hey.

416
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:32,068
I'm just tryin' to bring you up to speed, kid,
that's it.

417
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:34,571
Thanks.

418
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,034
I'll tell you what.

419
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,911
Give me a few hours
to figure out the moves,

420
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,164
and call me tonight in Vermont.

421
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:48,668
I'll be at the Sugarbush lodge, all right?

422
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:49,919
All right.

423
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:52,839
You all right?

424
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,592
Yeah, I guess so.

425
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,428
Okay.

426
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:03,266
Try to keep him down to four drinks a day.

427
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,186
If you can keep him down to 40,
you're doin' good.

428
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,855
We try to water them down a little.
Do you know how to do that?

429
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,899
It's a long ride, honey.

430
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,443
Get the bags in the car. I'll be right out.

431
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:17,155
Mommy, Mommy,
don't forget Uncle Frank's walk.

432
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:20,950
KAREN: Oh, yeah.

433
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,997
You have to air him out a little every day.

434
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,502
Why don't you go on back there,
get yourself oriented?

435
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:33,630
I'll come out in a minute,
give you telephone numbers and stuff.

436
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:39,803
FRANK: Well, I wouldn't try a thing like that
unless I knew, would I?

437
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,805
Just let me speak to her.

438
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,140
Hello, beautiful. Is that you?

439
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:46,309
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

440
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:48,853
(CHUCKLING)

441
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:52,816
You have a glass of wine with lunch?
You sound a little dusky. Hmm.

442
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,235
(CLEARING THROAT)

443
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:57,195
Just a minute, sweetheart.

444
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,323
You're back, huh?

445
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:02,909
Tenacious!

446
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,954
Get out my dress blues.
They're in a garment bag in the closet.

447
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,580
Check the top dresser drawer.

448
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:11,084
Take out the shoulder boards
and affix them, shoulders right and left,

449
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,628
ASAP. That means now.

450
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:16,339
Hello.

451
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:19,259
Sorry to keep you waiting, sweetheart.

452
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:21,970
I'm not the kind of guy
who likes to rush things,

453
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:24,931
but I'm catchin' a 4:00 at Logan,
I'm lookin' out my window,

454
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,808
and there's not a taxi in sight.

455
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:29,394
What happened to Chet?

456
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,312
He didn't invest in a radio yet?

457
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,314
Hah!

458
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:35,525
Well, get your driver on it.

459
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,611
Tell him to get a move on.

460
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:41,156
Yes. Mmm.

461
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:45,785
Some kind of body has got to
go with that bedroom voice.

462
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:48,371
One day I'm gonna swing by,
get a better look at it.

463
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,206
You bet.

464
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,376
Bye.

465
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,173
My Valpak's underneath the bed.

466
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,674
Get it out.

467
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,343
Put the boards on the blues and fold 'em in.

468
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,972
Are we going someplace, Colonel?

469
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,724
What business is that of yours?

470
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,602
Don't shrug, imbecile. I'm blind.

471
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:13,062
Save your body language for the bimbi.

472
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,398
Now, get my gear out.

473
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:19,068
KAREN: Francine, get in the car.

474
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:23,239
It's almost 3:00.
The goddamn <i>Flintstones</i> haven't left yet.

475
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,910
DONNY: Willie Rossi must go in the car.

476
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,163
Here comes Mrs. Rossi now.

477
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,456
Damn it!

478
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,417
She said goodbye to me three times today.

479
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,004
What has she got, separation anxiety?

480
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,923
Cut her off at the door.

481
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:44,427
Hi, honey. Bye, honey.

482
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:50,642
I wish you were coming with us.

483
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,519
Me, too.

484
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:53,937
Maybe next time.

485
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,944
- Drive carefully now.
- Yeah.

486
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:05,240
Charlie, this is where we'll be.

487
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:09,619
Good luck, Charlie.
Don't let him drink too much.

488
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,333
See you, Charlie.

489
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:18,962
And no 900 numbers. He loves to talk dirty.

490
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,472
FRANK: All right, let's get to work.

491
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,650
L-buckles givin' you trouble?

492
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,904
Never in the Boy Scouts, sluggo?

493
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,656
I made Tenderfoot.

494
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,575
Tenderfoot, my foot!

495
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,994
Convenience store mama's boy.

496
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,996
Here. Let me take a look at that.

497
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:57,333
Touch me again, I'll kill you,
you little son of a bitch!

498
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,128
I touch you.

499
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,506
Understand?

500
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:09,053
My shoulder boards are in
the top dresser drawer.

501
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,471
Get them, son.

502
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,557
The epaulets with the silver oak leaf.

503
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,452
Are these the …

504
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,537
Good. Taxi come yet?

505
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,374
Colonel, where are we going?

506
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,418
Where are we going?

507
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,670
Freak show central.

508
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,714
- Where's that?
- New York City.

509
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,052
That's in New York, son.

510
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:51,137
New York State.

511
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:54,098
Mrs. Rossi didn't say anything to me
about going anywhere.

512
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:55,391
She forgot.

513
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,227
Should we call her, 'cause I …

514
00:32:58,311 --> 00:32:59,896
You kidding me?

515
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,691
Call her? By the time they get to Albany
in that Hupmobile he drives

516
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:06,027
it'll be opening day at Saratoga.

517
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:08,321
Colonel, I can't go to New York City.

518
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:09,572
Why not?

519
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,241
New York …

520
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,577
New York's too much responsibility.

521
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,496
Ah, responsibility!

522
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:19,290
I had a lot of 17-year-olds
in my first platoon.

523
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:21,584
I took care of them. All set!

524
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,296
How do I look?

525
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,925
Tickets. Money.

526
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:30,802
Speech.

527
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:34,972
Old Washington joke
from my days with Lyndon.

(CAR HONKING)

529
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,268
(EXCLAIMS) I knew I could count
on transportation.

530
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:40,687
Are you ready?

531
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,775
This is not Panmunjom.
A simple yes will do.

532
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,611
- Um …
- Good! Here you go.

533
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:50,530
Come on! Hop to, son!

534
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,658
You're in front of me. Let's go.

535
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,493
(MEOWING)

536
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:57,370
Tomster, come here, boy.

537
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,498
Come on.

538
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,542
Here, Tomster, come on.

539
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,919
Tomster, Tomster. Yeah.

540
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:09,257
Remember, when in doubt,

541
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:11,092
fuck.

542
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,764
Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination?

543
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:20,017
Our destination,
New York City, home of the brave!

544
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:22,061
We got two for the shuttle to New York.

545
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:25,106
I'm not shuttling anywhere.
Look at those tickets. First class.

546
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:26,899
Yes, sir, first class.

547
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,985
Colonel, you bought me a ticket?

548
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,737
I never said I'd go to New York.

549
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,782
Oh, what are you, some kind of chicken-shit,
sticks to job description only?

550
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:36,743
Gate 46, sir.

551
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:38,327
As you were, son.

552
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:39,912
Thank you, sir.

553
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,456
Which way's the door?

554
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:45,626
Are you blind? Are you blind?

555
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,961
Of course not.

556
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:49,505
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm?

557
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:52,175
I take your arm.

558
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,723
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

559
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,350
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life?

560
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,519
- Gentlemen?
- Yeah!

561
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:08,232
- Jack Daniels.
- You bet.

562
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:12,028
And Diet Slice.

563
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:13,362
The old Diet Slice.

564
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:14,822
And a water.

565
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:17,116
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Certainly, sir.

566
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,290
(SIGHS LOUDLY)

567
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,210
- Mmm!
- How did you know her name?

568
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,589
Well, she's wearin' Floris.

569
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,383
That's an English cologne.

570
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:38,888
But her voice is California chickie.

571
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:42,850
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady.

572
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:45,061
I call her Daphne.

573
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:50,983
Oh, big things may happen
to that little thing of yours.

574
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:54,487
Look, Colonel,

575
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,533
- I'll get you to New York, all right?
- Uh-huh.

576
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:01,410
Then I'm gonna have to
turn around and come back.

577
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:04,247
Well, Chuck,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

578
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,749
Charlie, all right?

579
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,543
Or Charles.

580
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,920
Sorry. I can't blame you, though.

581
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,255
Chuck is a …

582
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:18,302
So, why are we going to New York?

583
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:21,931
All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.

584
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,517
Hoo-ah.

585
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,478
Where's Daphne? Let's get her down here.

586
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,024
She's in the back.

587
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,151
A tail's in the tail.

588
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,779
Hah!

589
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:39,031
Oh, but I still smell her.

590
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:40,366
(SNIFFING)

591
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,203
Women.

592
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,290
What can you say?

593
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:50,251
Who made 'em?

594
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,963
God must have been a fuckin' genius.

595
00:36:58,301 --> 00:36:59,677
The hair …

596
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:03,222
They say the hair is everything, you know.

597
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:09,020
Have you ever buried your nose
in a mountain of curls

598
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:12,607
and just wanted to go to sleep forever?

599
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:15,818
Or lips,

600
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:20,072
and when they touched, yours were like

601
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:23,326
that first swallow of wine

602
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:26,329
after you just crossed the desert.

603
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,125
Tits!

604
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,627
Hoo-ah.

605
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:36,172
Big ones, little ones,

606
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:41,636
nipples staring right out at you
like secret searchlights.

607
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:43,930
Mmm.

608
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:47,683
And legs …

609
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:52,188
I don't care if they're Greek columns

610
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,440
or secondhand Steinways.

611
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,360
What's between 'em,

612
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,155
passport to heaven.

613
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:04,617
I need a drink.

614
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:09,956
Yes, Mr. Simms,

615
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:16,253
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide world worth hearing.

616
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,052
Pussy.

617
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:25,513
Hah!

618
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:28,808
Are you listening to me, son?
I'm givin' you pearls here.

619
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,184
(LAUGHS)

620
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,603
I guess you really like women.

621
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,231
Oh, above all things!

622
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:44,532
A very, very distant second

623
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:47,868
is a Ferrari.

624
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:56,877
Charlie?

625
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,132
Give me your hand.

626
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:06,262
This is just the start of your education, son.

627
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:23,446
Hoo-ah.

628
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:25,322
Where are we?

629
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:26,866
Where are we, eh?

630
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,494
The cynosure of all things civilized.

631
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:32,621
The Waldorf-Astoria.

632
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:37,334
The last time I was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

633
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:38,836
Had a Ferrari.

634
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:42,214
Every day I held the door open
for the fucker.

635
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:44,467
Never even offered me a ride.

636
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,469
Well, fuck him.

637
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:48,637
He's dead and I'm blind.

638
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:53,976
Spread the word.

639
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,227
Thank you, sir.

640
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:57,229
And the intelligence will be forthcoming?

641
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:58,481
Sir?

642
00:39:58,564 --> 00:39:59,982
On the escort scene.

643
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:02,902
Yes, sir.

644
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:04,945
And welcome to the Waldorf.

645
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:06,363
<i>Gracias, amigo.</i>

646
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,658
Puerto Ricans.

647
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,577
Always made the best infantrymen.

648

(CLINKING)

649
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,211
Oh!

650
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:28,511
I'm home again.

651
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:31,680
Give me an inventory on this, will you?

652
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,939
All right, where am I, in Asia?

653
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:43,109
He told me the phone was on
the other side of the room, didn't he?

654
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:44,568
By the windows?

655
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:47,404
It's right here.

656
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,533
Okay.

657
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,576
We're in business.

658
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,874
Get me the Oak Room.

659
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,670
How's that inventory comin'?

660
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:06,549
There's Jim Beam

661
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:09,135
and Early Times.

662
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:11,053
Quartermaster's on the take again.

663
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,223
Hello. Is Sheldon or Mack there?

664
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,352
This is Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.

665
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:21,814
I used to be a regular.
I used to come in with a General Garbisch.

666
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:27,111
Yes, that's probably because
he's at Arlington, six feet under.

667
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:30,698
Listen up. I want a table for two,
and I don't mean Siberia,

668
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:32,241
8:15.

669
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:35,369
Clear them little bottles off.

670
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:39,206
And when I get off the phone,
call up Hyman.

671
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,251
Tell him I want it wall to wall
with John Daniels.

672
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:45,629
(CLEARING THROAT)
Don't you mean Jack Daniels?

673
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:49,508
He may be Jack to you, son. But when
you've known him as long as I have …

674
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:50,968
That's a joke. Hello!

675
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:54,054
This is Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.
I would like a limo,

676
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:55,472
8:00.

677
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,356
What are you drinkin'?

678
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,610
Nothing, thanks. I don't use it.

679
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:09,528
What's useful about it?

680
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:14,408
I don't know.
Listen, Colonel, I have to get going.

681
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:16,827
Where you goin'?

682
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:21,415
Back to school. I've got some real
important stuff I have to take care of.

683
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:23,375
Very well.

684
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:27,546
But I never let my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

685
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,091
You'll dine with me
and then my driver will transport you

686
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:34,261
to the airport for the Boston shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

687
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:39,225
Meanwhile, unpack my bag.

688
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,352
I'm gonna christen the latrine.

689
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:45,773
FRANK: What's your name, driver?

690
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:46,982
Manny, sir.

691
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:52,029
Manny. The bellhops at the Waldorf,
are they any good at getting escorts?

692
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:54,073
I wouldn't know, sir.

693
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:55,616
What would you know?

694
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,534
About what?

695
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:59,328
About you-know-what?

696
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:03,457
Maybe I could manage something.

697
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,918
FRANK: I'm talkin' top of the line, now.

698
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,711
Let me think about this, sir.

(SIGHS)

700
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:18,889
What's the matter with you?

701
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:20,182
With me?

702
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:22,893
Yeah. Car feels heavy. You know why?

703
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:25,854
You got the fuckin' weight of the world
on your shoulders.

(SIGHS)

705
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:32,569
I got a little problem at school, that's all.

706
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:33,946
Spit it out!

707
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,614
It's not a big deal, all right?

708
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:37,658
Where we going,
the Oak Room or somethin'?

709
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:40,452
If it's not a big deal,
why did you say real important stuff?

710
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:43,706
What are you doin',
banging the dean's daughter? Hah!

711
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,835
I'm just in a little trouble.

712
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:49,378
What kind of trouble?

713
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:52,047
I saw some guys doing something.

714
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:57,970
To tell or not to tell, or it's your ass.

715
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:00,222
Hmm?

716
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:03,309
How'd you know that?

717
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:06,020
I'm a wizard. Give me the details, come on.

718
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:10,774
(SIGHS)

719
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:14,194
There's this guy at school named Harry.

720
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:18,115
He's this real rich kid,
and he like, runs the show.

721
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:20,242
Who else?

722
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:25,956
There's another guy, George,
but George didn't do anything.

723
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,918
George and I saw Harry and his buddies
doin' somethin'.

724
00:44:30,002 --> 00:44:32,046
Now, the folks at Baird,

725
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:35,257
they know you and George
can identify the guilty parties?

726
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:40,262
Yeah, they think we can.

727
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,139
George is a friend of yours.

728
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:45,184
He's not a friend, but he's all right.

729
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:46,685
You trust him?

730
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:48,771
Yeah, I guess so.

731
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:51,398
He's on scholarship, too?

732
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:53,817
No, why?

733
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:57,196
We got George, we got Harry,
we got trouble.

734
00:44:57,279 --> 00:45:00,115
They're rich, you're poor.
You wanna get rich.

735
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,577
You wanna graduate Baird,
become a rich big shot like them.

736
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,079
- Am I right?
- No.

737
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:06,955
It's not that way at all.

738
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:09,124
Okay, Charlie!

739
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,462
Here we are, gentlemen, the Oak Room.

740
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:15,547
The Oak Room!

741
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,051
Bring us a menu
and double Jack Daniels on the rocks.

742
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:21,053
Charlie, sit down here.

743
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:23,931
Perhaps you'll feel more
comfortable in this, sir.

744
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:32,314
(WHISTLES) You look great!

745
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:38,570
Thank you.

746
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:42,866
Here we are, Charlie, the Oak Room.

747
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:46,120
Now, read me the bill of fare.

748
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,414
Let's see.

749
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:51,834
You got the Oak Room
burger and fries for $24.

750
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:53,544
Where's the booze?

751
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:55,170
Flowin' like mud around here.

752
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:56,713
A $24 hamburger?

753
00:45:58,257 --> 00:45:59,508
What's the story?

754
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:01,176
What story?

755
00:46:02,553 --> 00:46:04,471
Are you a rich miser or something?

756
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:06,140
Hah!

757
00:46:06,223 --> 00:46:08,684
No, I'm just your average blind man.

758
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,519
Your average blind man.

759
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,231
How do you plan on
paying for all this stuff?

760
00:46:14,857 --> 00:46:16,733
Crisp, clean dollars.

761
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:18,277
American.

762
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,320
I saved up my disability checks.

763
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:23,615
How much did you save?
I mean, we flew first class,

764
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:27,035
we're at the Waldorf-Astoria,
a $24 hamburger restaurant.

765
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,037
All part of a plan, Charlie.

766
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:30,747
You want to let me in on it?

767
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:33,584
Why should I?
You're not interested. You don't give a shit!

768
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:37,963
You're leavin' on that last shuttle
out of LaGuardia.

769
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,882
Hmm? Ooh!

770
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:45,179
You got 15 minutes, son.
I don't think you're gonna make it.

771
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:49,433
Unless the Oak Room keeps some
complimentary helicopter on the roof.

772
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:51,685
No, sir. No!

773
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:54,813
You're here till tomorrow.

774
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:58,525
You said the last shuttle
leaves at 2200 hours.

775
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:00,569
That's 10:00, right?

776
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,071
Last I heard, yeah.

777
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,407
It's only 8:30.

778
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:07,910
I lied. Leaves at 9:00.

779
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:10,037
It leaves at 9:00?

780
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:11,872
Calm down. Calm down.

781
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,292
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

782
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,252
The truth is, Charlie,

783
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:22,758
I need a guide dog
to help me execute my plan.

784
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:24,551
What plan?

785
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:27,638
You have a right to know.

786
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:32,100
It's not really a plan, Charlie. It's sort of a …

787
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:34,603
More like a tour,

788
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:37,648
a little tour of pleasures.

789
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:42,069
Stay in a first-class hotel,
eat an agreeable meal,

790
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:45,113
drink a nice glass of wine,

791
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,325
see my big brother.

792
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:51,078
Nothing like family, you know.

793
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:55,123
And then, make love to a terrific woman.

794
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:58,877
After that …

795
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,093
Yeah?

796
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:12,975
I'm gonna lie down on
my big, beautiful bed at the Waldorf

797
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:14,893
and blow my brains out.

798
00:48:18,814 --> 00:48:20,566
May I tell you our specials?

799
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:22,150
You may, sir.

800
00:48:22,693 --> 00:48:27,030
Tonight we have charred venison with
buckwheat spaetzle and green peppercorn.

801
00:48:27,114 --> 00:48:30,742
Grilled veal paillards,
tomato tapenade, and roasted eggplants.

802
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:32,703
Get me a napkin. My mouth's watering.

803
00:48:32,786 --> 00:48:34,997
If you would like our
crème soufflé for dessert,

804
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,999
it would be a good idea to order now.

805
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:41,044
Yes, on the soufflé.
Give us a half a minute on the rest.

806
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,879
Very good, sir.

808
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,011
I'm leaning towards the spaetzle.

809
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:52,431
- Colonel Slade …
- Charlie, rolls on the table?

810
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:53,682
Give 'em to me.

811
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,976
You should try these rolls, Charlie.

812
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:59,605
I used to dream about them
when I was at Fort Huachuca.

813
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:02,357
- Colonel Slade …
- Bread's no good west of the Colorado.

814
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:04,234
Water's too alkaline.

815
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:05,777
Colonel Slade, did you say …

816

(SNIFFING)

817
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,281
Did I hear you right?

818
00:49:10,616 --> 00:49:12,951
You said you're gonna kill yourself?

819
00:49:13,035 --> 00:49:14,328
No.

820
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:16,371
I said I was gonna blow my brains out.

821
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:19,666
Try one of these rolls, Charlie.

822
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,710
I buttered it for you.

823
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:23,879
I don't want a roll, all right?

824
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:25,714
Okay. Have a radish!

825
00:49:26,757 --> 00:49:28,050
Hah!

00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:33,430
Hello! Bring me a double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

Too many men, far better than you,
have executed that courtesy.

00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:28,874
FRANK: (SINGING) <i>But if you've got
somethin' that must be done</i>

890
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:33,128
<i>And it can only be done by one</i>

891
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:36,172
Sofia,

892
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:40,260
what are the chances
of suitin' you up sometime?

893
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:44,973
- WOMAN: <i>Sugarbush Lodge.</i>
- George Willis, please.

894
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:48,894
GEORGE: <i>Hello.</i>

895
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:50,562
George! Hey, it's Charlie.

896
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:54,274
<i>Hey, Chas.
Next year you gotta come up with us.</i>

897
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:57,652
<i>White powder on a base of snow bunnies.</i>

898
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:01,364
<i>Chas, are you there?</i>

899
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,742
Yeah, I'm here.

900
00:54:03,825 --> 00:54:06,161
You told me to call you for the moves.

901
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:07,495
<i>All right.</i>

902
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:10,916
<i>For now, the move's no move, status quo.</i>

903
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,709
<i>Everything's the way we left it.</i>

904
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,252
How did we leave it?

905
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:18,089
<i>See no evil, hear no evil.</i>

906
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,051
<i>You know what I mean, Chas?</i>

907
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:25,513
Yeah. See no evil, hear no evil.

908
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:29,976
<i>Okay, then, walk like you talk.</i>

909
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,312
All right, bye.

910
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:35,023
George Willis, huh?

911
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:37,192
Yeah.

912
00:54:37,943 --> 00:54:39,444
George Willis.

913
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:42,781
That makes his father
probably George Willis, Senior.

914
00:54:43,865 --> 00:54:45,784
Charlie, I ask you,

915
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:49,788
what do you think
big George is gonna feel about little George

916
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:52,916
seeing no evil, hearing no evil?

917
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,587
Well, we're not gonna tell our parents.

918
00:54:57,796 --> 00:55:00,715
We're just gonna keep it between ourselves.

919
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:04,219
Oh, George isn't gonna tell his father
about this thing!

920
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:06,179
Damn decent of him.

921
00:55:06,262 --> 00:55:07,889
(EXCLAIMS)

922
00:55:07,973 --> 00:55:10,016
<i>- Scusi, Colonnello.
- Prego.</i>

923
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,893
I love it when you hurt me.

924
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:15,230
Tell me now, Charlie.

925
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:19,275
This George Willis, Jr., what's his father do?

926
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:21,736
I don't really know.

927
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,655
Well, I'm gonna tell you.

928
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,824
When George Willis, Senior,

929
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:28,618
isn't busy as a million-dollar man
for Aetna Casualty …

930
00:55:28,702 --> 00:55:32,497
Or is it New England distributor
for the Chrysler Corporation?

931
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:36,584
He concerns himself with
his young son, George Willis, Jr.

932
00:55:37,544 --> 00:55:39,921
George isn't going to say anything
to his father.

933
00:55:40,005 --> 00:55:41,756
Oh, Charlie.

934
00:55:42,215 --> 00:55:44,467
Big George is gonna wind up little George,

935
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:47,554
and little George is gonna
sing like a canary.

936
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:50,140
And if you're hip, kid,
you're gonna hop to, too.

937
00:55:50,557 --> 00:55:52,684
You've got this all figured out, don't you?

938
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:56,855
It don't take no Young American merit
scholarship to figure this one out.

939
00:55:56,938 --> 00:55:58,982
Charlie, you had a little life,

940
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:03,862
so you decided to go to the Baird school
to put yourself in the market for a big one.

941
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:05,822
Now, in order to stay in the running,

942
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:09,743
you're gonna have to tell these people
what they want to know.

943
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:11,536
You think so?

944
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:12,662
Are we finished, Sofia?

945
00:56:12,746 --> 00:56:14,414
- Yes.
<i>- Grazie. Grazie. Andate.</i>

946
00:56:17,876 --> 00:56:19,419
Charlie,

947
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:22,797
if you don't sing now,

948
00:56:23,465 --> 00:56:26,843
you're gonna end up,
not only shelving biscuits

949
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:29,888
in some convenience store
in the Oregon 'burbs,

950
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:32,807
but probably the last word
you'll ever hear yourself say

951
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:35,101
just before you croak, gonna be,

952
00:56:35,185 --> 00:56:38,980
"Have a nice day and come back soon."

953
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:40,899
Sofia!

954
00:56:40,982 --> 00:56:42,734
Measure up Charlie, here, <i>pronto.</i>

955
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:44,778
We got a date for Thanksgiving.

956
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:46,696
We got a date?

957
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:48,823
My brother's place.

958
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:52,118
W.R. Slade, White Plains, New York.

959
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:55,163
Colonel, I can't go with you
to your brother's place.

960
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:58,333
I mean, I should be getting back to school.

961
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:04,923
Well, you gotta have
Thanksgiving somewhere.

962
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:07,092
I mean, eats and treats.

963
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:09,010
I can use the company, Charlie.

964
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:13,890
All right.

965
00:57:13,973 --> 00:57:15,433
Does he know I'm comin'?

966
00:57:15,517 --> 00:57:16,935
He doesn't know I'm comin'.

967
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:20,438
But wait till you see the look on his face
when I walk through the door.

968
00:57:20,522 --> 00:57:22,065
Oh, he loves me!

969
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:28,238
Oh, Charlie, about your little problem,

970
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:30,907
there are two kinds of people in this world:

971
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:35,203
those who stand up and face the music,
and those who run for cover.

972
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:36,830
Cover's better.

973
00:57:36,913 --> 00:57:39,040
Okay, Sofia, suit him up!

974
00:57:39,124 --> 00:57:40,750
Make him pretty.

975
00:57:57,225 --> 00:57:58,810
Careful.

976
00:58:00,103 --> 00:58:02,063
- Should I ring it?
- Yeah.

977
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:13,158
- Yes?
- Yes!

978
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:14,742
Who is this?

979
00:58:15,118 --> 00:58:16,619
It's Randy.

980
00:58:16,786 --> 00:58:18,621
Randy? You new?

981
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:21,082
I'm your nephew.

982
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:23,585
Hah! Here I am!

983
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:25,670
Your sister's been hoarding me
long enough.

984
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:28,715
Thought it's time
to spread the riches around.

985
00:58:29,132 --> 00:58:31,384
- Uncle Frank.
- Gloria!

986
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:33,428
- Gail.
- Of course.

987
00:58:34,262 --> 00:58:37,056
Say hello to the potluck party
from New York City.

988
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,518
Good old Uncle Frank
and this here with him is Charlie Simms,

989
00:58:40,602 --> 00:58:43,438
star halfback of the Baird football team.

990
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:47,400
They not only beat Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School, too.

991
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:50,069
Where's your miserable father?

992
00:58:50,153 --> 00:58:52,405
Wait! No, no. Let's surprise him.

993
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:56,117
Give that fat heart of his an attack. Willie!

994
00:58:58,119 --> 00:58:59,579
Ho, Willie!

995
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,302
Hello, Frank.

996
00:59:14,844 --> 00:59:17,055
- How you doin'?
- Okay.

997
00:59:17,138 --> 00:59:18,556
Here's my hand.

998
00:59:20,183 --> 00:59:22,435
Charlie, meet W.R. Slade.

999
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:23,895
Nice to meet you, sir.

1000
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,731
The original bulging briefcase man.

1001
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:29,567
Gretchen, I smell those prunes!

1002
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:31,736
- We talkin' turkey Marbella?
- Yes, we are.

1003
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:33,238
(WHOOPS)

1004
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:36,616
Let's have a whiff. Come on.

1005
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:38,701
You know, I always had a sneaker for you.
Come here.

1006
00:59:38,785 --> 00:59:39,786
(SNIFFING)

1007
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:41,120
(COUGHS)

1008
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:42,705
(EXCLAIMS)

1009
00:59:42,956 --> 00:59:45,250
- Where are you, Garry? I heard you cough.
- GARRY: Right here.

1010
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:46,960
Who are you again?

1011
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:51,923
I'm here at the Waldorf with …
Is it your brother?

1012
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:54,509
W.R.'s final issue. How ya doin', son?

1013
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:57,095
Yeah, sure, Frank's my brother.
Who the hell are you?

1014
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:59,847
I'm takin' care of him for the weekend.

1015
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:01,099
Charlie.

1016
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:04,143
Sorry.

1017
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:06,354
Where's the booze?

1018
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:07,939
Flowin' like mud here.

1019
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:11,693
To tell the truth,
the Colonel's not well, I don't think.

1020
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:13,361
Not well?

1021
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:15,738
I think he's a little lonely.

1022
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:18,449
Why didn't you take him
to your family's for dinner?

1023
01:00:18,533 --> 01:00:20,034
I heard that!

1024
01:00:21,953 --> 01:00:23,371
I heard that.

1025
01:00:23,454 --> 01:00:26,624
Pay no attention to him, Charlie.
That's just big-brother talk.

1026
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:29,294
He's been watching out
for me since day one.

1027
01:00:29,377 --> 01:00:34,299
Bailed me out of more trouble
than he'd like to remember. Hmm?

1028
01:00:34,382 --> 01:00:36,259
GRETCHEN: Here, let me take your coat.

1029
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:40,513
I meant to pick up some <i>vino</i> on my way up,
but I blew it.

1030
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:43,141
I'll send you the Rothschild again
for Christmas,

1031
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:45,601
only let's see how Thanksgiving goes.

1032
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:47,103
I'll set two more places.

1033
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:48,563
Here's your drink, Frank.

1034
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:50,440
Oh, thank you, Randy.

1035
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:52,734
Still with Snow Queen Sugar?

1036
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:56,904
Snow Flake.
Why do you always get that wrong?

1037
01:00:57,238 --> 01:00:59,282
Because it's not important
for me to get it right.

1038
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:00,992
What are you doing there now?

1039
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,578
I'm vice president for marketing.

1040
01:01:03,745 --> 01:01:06,414
Hoo-ah! Congratulations!

1041
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:08,041
Sugar is shit, though.

1042
01:01:08,124 --> 01:01:11,336
I told General Abrams,
install honey in the commissaries.

1043
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:15,173
If K-50s didn't blow your brains out,
sugar, sure as shit, was gonna.

1044
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:16,424
(FRANK LAUGHS)

1045
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:17,508
Why don't we all sit down?

1046
01:01:17,592 --> 01:01:18,634
Ooh. (SNIFFING)

1047
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:22,513
Mitsouki. Rhymes with nookie. Be careful.

1048
01:01:22,597 --> 01:01:25,350
When the wife gets restless,
the wife gets racy.

1049
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:27,018
Well, let's go and eat, shall we?

1050
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:28,519
By all means.

1051
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:31,731
Thank you, Charlie.

1052
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:35,902
Where you wanna sit, Frank?
At the head again?

1053
01:01:35,985 --> 01:01:39,781
Any old card table will do. This is fine.

1054
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:43,034
Where was I? Oh.

1055
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:46,371
So, I wake up. It's 4:00 in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with

1056
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:48,790
or why I'm there, or where I am.

1057
01:01:49,374 --> 01:01:52,251
What am I gonna do? I got this Asian flower

1058
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:56,631
on one hand, all giggly and dewy-like,

1059
01:01:57,048 --> 01:02:01,052
and this hard-boiled Navy nurse
outta Omaha, on the other.

1060
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:04,889
We're three across the bed,
not a stitch of clothes on.

1061
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,766
It comes to me.

1062
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:12,146
Let east meet west.
We'll build a golden bridge.

(FRANK CHUCKLES)

1064
01:02:14,232 --> 01:02:17,235
I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers!

1065
01:02:23,324 --> 01:02:24,992
We all still here?

1066
01:02:25,952 --> 01:02:27,954
It's a beautiful story.

1067
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:34,085
Do you always enjoy
shocking people, Uncle Frank?

1068
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:35,253
Honey …

1069
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:37,755
I didn't know
you were so easily shocked, Randy.

1070
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,049
I admire your sensibilities, I'm touched.

1071
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:43,094
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank

1072
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,263
to go to the kennel?

1073
01:02:45,346 --> 01:02:46,431
What about it?

1074
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:48,766
He almost put the seeing eye dog business
outta business.

1075
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:50,017
Cool it, Randy.

1076
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:51,978
It's over and done with.

1077
01:02:52,395 --> 01:02:54,272
FRANK: Indeed it is, Garry.

1078
01:02:54,355 --> 01:02:56,441
Indeed it is. So is dinner.

1079
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:58,109
Charlie, what time you have?

1080
01:02:58,192 --> 01:02:59,694
I think we better be gettin' back.

1081
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:02,864
You ever given any thought to
a Braille watch, Frank?

1082
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:03,948
Randy …

1083
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:07,577
Stevie Wonder wears one,
or do you rank on him, too?

1084
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:08,786
Honey, please.

1085
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,164
It's all right, Gloria.
I enjoy Randy's observations.

1086
01:03:11,247 --> 01:03:13,374
My wife's name is Gail, Frank.

1087
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,334
Can you hear that? Gail.

1088
01:03:15,418 --> 01:03:17,712
Excuse me. Gail.

1089
01:03:18,463 --> 01:03:21,340
Gail strikes me as a very beautiful woman,

1090
01:03:21,424 --> 01:03:24,177
but, you know,
there's a little tension in her voice.

1091
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,013
I don't know what it is.
It could be one of two things,

1092
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:29,724
either Gail is nervous or unsatisfied.

1093
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,561
What's your point, Uncle Frank?

1094
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:35,104
You ought to go down on her.

1095
01:03:35,188 --> 01:03:37,440

- Cut it out, Frank, will ya?

1096
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:41,652
You've gotten so wrapped up in sugar,
you forgotten the taste of real honey!

1097
01:03:41,736 --> 01:03:43,196
Frank, for God's sake!

1098
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:44,363
Hear that voice?

1099
01:03:44,447 --> 01:03:45,990
There's fire under that dress.

1100
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:48,201
- Will you cut it out?
- Just get the fuck outta here.

1101
01:03:48,284 --> 01:03:50,244
- Hoo-ah!
- RANDY: Get in your limousine.

1102
01:03:50,328 --> 01:03:54,373
Go down to the Bowery. Get with
the other fucking drunks, where you belong!

1103
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:55,541
Wait a minute.

1104
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:57,418
- What?
- Can you take it easy?

1105
01:03:57,502 --> 01:03:58,586
RANDY: What for?

1106
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:02,173
You want me to lay off him, Chucky,
'cause he's blind?

1107
01:04:02,715 --> 01:04:03,674
No, but …

1108
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:05,760
My friend's name is Charles.

1109
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:07,762
He doesn't like to be called Chucky.

1110
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:10,223
This is supposed to be
a family get-together.

1111
01:04:10,306 --> 01:04:11,641
Just a warning.

1112
01:04:11,724 --> 01:04:15,520
Jesus Christ, another sucker who thinks
this shit-heel's a war hero.

1113
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:16,729
Hoo-ah!

1114
01:04:19,232 --> 01:04:21,859
Well, once, maybe.

1115
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:26,280
I suppose he told you about his days
on Lyndon Johnson's staff?

1116
01:04:26,364 --> 01:04:28,950
I was gonna go. Now I'm not leaving. Hah!

1117
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:31,911
Frank was earmarked for general.

1118
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:34,080
Earmarked, good word.

1119
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:36,541
Frank likes to spit in everybody's eye!

1120
01:04:36,624 --> 01:04:37,875
Randy, that's enough.

1121
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:42,296
So they, what do they call it,
when they give you the shaft in the military?

1122
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,673
Passed over!

1123
01:04:43,756 --> 01:04:46,676
Right, Frank was passed over for promotion.

1124
01:04:47,468 --> 01:04:48,886
Couple times.

1125
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:54,183
You wanna know what happened then?

1126
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:55,726
Will you shut your mouth?

1127
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:57,144
He blew himself up.

1128
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:58,646
Stop it, Randy.

1129
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:01,899
Our Colonel here had a grenade juggling act

1130
01:05:01,983 --> 01:05:04,402
at Fort Bragg, or wherever
it was they dumped him.

1131
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:05,486
Fort Benning.

1132
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:08,406
He was teaching hand-to-hand combat
to second lieutenants …

1133
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:10,950
Randy, look at me
when you're talking to me, now, son.

1134
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:15,288
I'm lookin', Frank.
His partner in the act was some captain.

1135
01:05:15,371 --> 01:05:16,914
Major Vincent Squires.

1136
01:05:16,998 --> 01:05:18,165
RANDY: Whoever he was.

1137
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:20,918
Before going on,
they'd have a lo-cal breakfast,

1138
01:05:21,002 --> 01:05:23,796
a screwdriver for Frank,
bloody mary for his partner.

1139
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:25,631
No, Vincent drank Sea Breezes.

1140
01:05:25,715 --> 01:05:30,845
The Judge Advocate at Benning said
Colonel Slade had four to his partner's one.

1141
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:34,557
He's really flying in class.
He gets all excited.

1142
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,976
He starts pulling the pins out.

1143
01:05:39,437 --> 01:05:41,689
One grenade got away from him.

1144
01:05:42,023 --> 01:05:43,190
Boom.

1145
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:47,695
The one that got away.

1146
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:50,406
RANDY: The pin was in, Frank claims.

1147
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:53,993
In or out, what difference does it make?

1148
01:05:54,076 --> 01:05:56,954
What kind of fucking lunatic
juggles grenades?

1149
01:05:57,663 --> 01:05:58,914
Vinnie came out okay.

1150
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:01,208
All Frank lost was his eyesight.

1151
01:06:05,588 --> 01:06:06,714
You wanna know the truth?

1152
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:08,299
Got a handle on that, do you?

1153
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:09,800
He was an asshole before.

01:06:09,884 --> 01:06:11,135
Hoo-ah!

1155
01:06:12,845 --> 01:06:15,306

- Colonel, let go.

01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,786
Will you give me your weapon?

1236
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:54,079
Oh, Charlie,

1237
01:12:54,163 --> 01:12:56,498
I'm a lieutenant colonel, United States Army.

1238
01:12:56,582 --> 01:12:59,084
I'm not giving my fucking gun to anyone.

1239
01:12:59,168 --> 01:13:01,545
Now, what are you drinkin'?

1240
01:13:01,628 --> 01:13:04,006
Colonel, this is unacceptable.

1241
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:07,092
Unacceptable? What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for?

1242
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:08,552
Unacceptable?

1243
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:12,264
What have they done,
taken the Oregon out of the boy?

1244
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:14,725
Put in Harvard Business School?

1245
01:13:15,684 --> 01:13:17,311
Then give me your bullets.

1246
01:13:23,484 --> 01:13:26,695
You do see the sense of it, Charlie,
don't you?

1247
01:13:29,656 --> 01:13:31,992
I can't chew the leather anymore.

1248
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:37,414
So, why should I share
the tribe's provisions?

1249
01:13:40,084 --> 01:13:41,960
I mean, there's no one

1250
01:13:42,628 --> 01:13:45,339
wants to tear a herring with me anymore.

1251
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:49,635
The bullets, Colonel.

1252
01:13:49,802 --> 01:13:51,220
"The bullets, Colonel."

1253
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:54,681
You sound like a guy in
<i>Lives of a Bengal Lancer.</i>

1254
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:16,036
What do you give a shit for?

1255
01:14:17,371 --> 01:14:18,872
About what?

1256
01:14:18,956 --> 01:14:20,332
About what?

1257
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:23,669
About whether I blow my brains out or not.

1258
01:14:29,842 --> 01:14:31,593
Because I have a conscience.

1259
01:14:31,677 --> 01:14:33,387
You have a conscience.

1260
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:35,973
I forgot.

1261
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:39,351
The Charlie Conscience.

1262
01:14:41,353 --> 01:14:43,814
Do we tell? Do we not tell?

1263
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:48,235
Do we follow the rich boy's code or not?

1264
01:14:49,236 --> 01:14:51,405
Do we let this blind asshole

1265
01:14:52,281 --> 01:14:54,408
die or not?

1266
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,243
Yeah.

1267
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:58,495
Conscience, Charlie.

1268
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,373
When were you born, son?

1269
01:15:01,707 --> 01:15:03,750
Around the time of the Round Table?

1270
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:05,002
(SCOFFS)

1271
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:07,004
Haven't you heard?

1272
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:10,299
Conscience is dead.

1273
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:12,926
No, I haven't heard.

1274
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:16,722
Then take the fucking wax outta your ears!

1275
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:21,059
Grow up!

1276
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:33,947
It's fuck your buddy.

1277
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,117
Cheat on your wife.

1278
01:15:40,454 --> 01:15:42,956
Call your mother on Mother's Day.

1279
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,418
Charlie,

1280
01:15:47,586 --> 01:15:49,463
it's all shit.

1281
01:16:01,016 --> 01:16:02,601
Where you goin'?

1282
01:16:03,477 --> 01:16:05,187
I got piss call.

1283
01:16:06,855 --> 01:16:09,900
I know I said I need ya for just one day

1284
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:12,486
but even I can't hold it that long.

1285
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:16,406
Oh, and Charlie,

1286
01:16:17,991 --> 01:16:20,494
you forgot the one in the chamber.

1287
01:16:25,332 --> 01:16:26,667
Hah!

1288
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:30,045
There you go, sir.

1289
01:16:30,796 --> 01:16:32,047
Thank you.

1290
01:16:35,092 --> 01:16:37,386
Twenty-six years in the service,

1291
01:16:38,053 --> 01:16:40,347
never let an aide shine my shoes.

1292
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:43,809
Where you gonna be in 26 years, Charlie?

1293
01:16:44,393 --> 01:16:48,188
Playing golf with your friends
from the Baird School, I bet.

1294
01:16:49,064 --> 01:16:50,274
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

1295
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:53,527
I don't even like those guys.

1296
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:56,446
Of course you don't. They're all assholes.

1297
01:16:57,656 --> 01:17:00,367
Be a pleasure to squeal on 'em, wouldn't it?

1298
01:17:01,118 --> 01:17:02,786
Yeah, well, I'm not a squealer.

1299
01:17:02,869 --> 01:17:04,329
"I'm not a squealer."

1300
01:17:04,413 --> 01:17:06,623
What is this, the Dreyfus case?

1301
01:17:11,128 --> 01:17:13,213
Ooh. Ooh, mama!

1302
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,132
BARBER: There you go.

1303
01:17:15,215 --> 01:17:16,633
Thank you.

1304
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:18,385
BARBER: Thank you.

1305
01:17:19,219 --> 01:17:20,762
Watch your step.

1306
01:17:23,265 --> 01:17:26,351
I'm gettin' that heavy feelin' again, Charlie.

1307
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:31,898
There's more to this, isn't there?

1308
01:17:33,233 --> 01:17:34,735
Isn't there?

1309
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:39,906
I was offered a bribe.

1310
01:17:40,407 --> 01:17:42,117
Now we're cookin'.

1311
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:45,746
Mr. Trask, the headmaster,

1312
01:17:48,165 --> 01:17:50,000
he promised to get me into Harvard.

1313
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,585
If you squeal.

1314
01:17:52,252 --> 01:17:53,295
Yeah.

1315
01:17:53,378 --> 01:17:55,172
What a dilemma.

1316
01:17:55,255 --> 01:17:59,092
Should Charlie Simms accept a free ride
into Harvard, or not?

1317
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:05,182
What do you think your friend George
would do if he were in your shoes?

1318
01:18:05,265 --> 01:18:06,683
He is, practically.

1319
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:08,143
How?

1320
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:12,481
It's just that Mr. Trask hasn't promised
to get him into Harvard.

1321
01:18:12,564 --> 01:18:14,316
Mr. Trask doesn't have to.

1322
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:16,777
George's father's gonna take care of that.

1323
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:21,073
Do the deal, Charlie. Take it!

1324
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:23,116
Go to Harvard.

1325
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:25,369
I can't do that.

1326
01:18:25,452 --> 01:18:26,620
Why not?

1327
01:18:28,955 --> 01:18:31,792
There are just some things you can't do.

1328
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:34,294
Explain 'em to me.

1329
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:37,214
Louder, please.

1330
01:18:37,297 --> 01:18:38,632
I can't …

1331
01:18:40,801 --> 01:18:44,221
You're gonna have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

1332
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:48,809
To ease the blow,
let me buy you a drink. Come on.

1333
01:18:50,352 --> 01:18:52,687
FRANK: Double Jack Daniels on the rocks.

1334
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:55,982
And bring my young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

1335
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:58,819
Hold on. Do you have beer?

1336
01:18:59,111 --> 01:19:01,530
Certainly. May I see some ID?

1337
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:04,825
Are you interested in walkin'
the rest of your life, chappy?

1338
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:06,076
I'm sorry, sir, but …

1339
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:09,246
I'm a regular here. My boy's going on 23.

1340
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:12,374
Why don't you call up front, the office?

1341
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:15,252
Mr. Gilbert, he's a friend of mine.

1342
01:19:15,502 --> 01:19:17,295
(ORCHESTRA PLAYING)

1343
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:19,297
Any particular beer?

1344
01:19:19,381 --> 01:19:22,175
Schlitz. No Schlitz?

1345
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:25,011
Blatz. No Blatz?

1346
01:19:26,138 --> 01:19:27,389
Improvise.

1347
01:19:28,598 --> 01:19:29,975
I'll do my best, sir.

1348
01:19:30,058 --> 01:19:31,935
Thank you, sir.

1349
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:35,397
You're human, Charlie. Beer?

1350
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,902
Who are we drinking with?

1351
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:44,656
I'm getting a nice soap-and-water feeling
from down there.

1352
01:19:52,747 --> 01:19:54,541
A female.

1353
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,376
"Female"?

1354
01:19:57,002 --> 01:20:00,672
You callin' her female must mean
you like her or you wouldn't be so casual.

1355
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:02,174
(CHUCKLES)

1356
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:05,552
Is she alone?

1357
01:20:05,635 --> 01:20:07,012
Yeah, she's alone.

1358
01:20:09,097 --> 01:20:10,765
Things are heatin' up.

1359
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:12,934
Chestnut hair?

1360
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:15,729
Brown, light brown.

1361
01:20:17,898 --> 01:20:19,316
Twenty-two?

1362
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:24,070
What am I, a guy at a carnival?

1363
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:27,491
The day we stop lookin', Charlie,
is the day we die.

1364
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:29,618
Move.

1365
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:31,828
- Where?
- You know where, son.

1366
01:20:31,912 --> 01:20:33,747
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1367
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:38,710
This woman is made for you. I can feel it.

1368
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:41,463
Goddamn beautiful, isn't she?

1369
01:20:41,713 --> 01:20:44,591
- She's not bad.
- Bingo! The boy's alive.

1370
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,595
Come on, son, perambulate.

1371
01:20:49,596 --> 01:20:51,139
Perambulate.

1372
01:21:00,732 --> 01:21:04,152
Excuse me, <i>señorita,</i>
do you mind if we join you?

1373
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:08,657
I'm feelin' you're being neglected.

1374
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:11,618
I'm expecting somebody.

1375
01:21:13,662 --> 01:21:15,038
Instantly?

1376
01:21:16,414 --> 01:21:18,208
No, but any minute now.

1377
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,543
Any minute?

1378
01:21:19,626 --> 01:21:22,420
Some people live a lifetime in a minute.

1379
01:21:23,588 --> 01:21:25,674
What are you doin' right now?

1380
01:21:25,966 --> 01:21:28,051
I'm waiting for him.

1381
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:31,263
Would you mind if we waited with you,

1382
01:21:32,514 --> 01:21:35,517
just to keep the womanizers
from bothering you?

1383
01:21:39,312 --> 01:21:40,981
No, I don't mind.

1384
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:42,816
Thank you.

1385
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:47,487
Charlie.

1386
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:54,411
You know, I detect a fragrance in the air.

1387
01:21:54,494 --> 01:21:56,496
Don't tell me what it is.

1388
01:21:57,497 --> 01:21:59,374
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1389
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:02,752
That's amazing.

1390
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:04,921
I'm in the amazing business.

1391
01:22:05,005 --> 01:22:07,007
It is Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1392
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,884
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

1393
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:12,095
Oh! I'm crazy about your grandmother.

1394
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:14,764
I think she'd have liked Charlie, too.

1395
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:16,975
Don't pay any attention to him.

1396
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:18,476
What's your name?

1397
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,769
Donna.

1398
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:22,939
Donna? I'm Frank. This here is …

1399
01:22:23,023 --> 01:22:24,274
Charlie.

1400
01:22:24,357 --> 01:22:26,192
Yes. She likes you.

1401
01:22:27,277 --> 01:22:29,195
Charlie's having a difficult weekend.

1402
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:30,739
He's going through a crisis.

1403
01:22:30,822 --> 01:22:33,617
How does he look like he's holding up?

1404
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,577
He looks fine to me.

1405
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,662
Oh! She does like you, Charlie.

1406
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:45,003
So, Donna,

1407
01:22:47,922 --> 01:22:49,424
do you tango?

1408
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:52,719
No. I wanted to learn once, but …

1409
01:22:53,261 --> 01:22:54,387
But?

1410
01:22:56,056 --> 01:22:57,807
But Michael didn't want to.

1411
01:22:57,891 --> 01:22:59,100
Michael.

1412

these things are walkin' outta the store?

1605

This is a Ferrari, sir, the finest machinery
made in the automobile industry.

1606

you can boil an egg on the engine.

Yes.

<i>Who was it?</i>

2120
02:15:21,490 --> 02:15:24,743
Well, I have an idea who it was.

2121
02:15:24,826 --> 02:15:26,369
<i>No, not an idea, Mr. Willis.</i>

2122

2126
02:15:45,889 --> 02:15:48,975
I was in the library. I'd taken my glasses off,

2127
02:15:49,059 --> 02:15:51,645

2128
02:15:57,067 --> 02:15:58,777
Then I helped Simms close up

2129
02:15:58,860 --> 02:16:01,780
and the next thing I know, we're outside,

2130
02:16:01,863 --> 02:16:03,907
and I hear this sound and I

2131
02:16:06,076 --> 02:16:08,912
didn't have any time to put my contacts in.

02:16:43,196 --> 02:16:44,406
What?

2138
02:16:45,448 --> 02:16:46,783
You mean definitively?

02:18:10,533 --> 02:18:13,453

Mr. Simms doesn't want it.

Because he's not a Baird man.

2286
02:26:06,717 --> 02:26:08,678
How's that for cornball?

2287
02:26:30,199 --> 02:26:32,285
Nothing can shut them up, sir.

2288
02:26:34,704 --> 02:26:36,080
(SILENCE)

2289
02:26:36,789 --> 02:26:39,959
<i>The disciplinary committee will take
this matter under advisement</i>

2290
02:26:40,042 --> 02:26:42,211
<i>in closed session.</i>

2291
02:26:42,503 --> 02:26:44,213
(MURMURING)

2292
02:26:50,219 --> 02:26:52,430
What are they doin', Charlie?

2293
02:26:53,222 --> 02:26:56,392
I think they're going to
come to a decision now.

2294
02:26:59,729 --> 02:27:01,063
Very well.

2295
02:27:06,569 --> 02:27:09,405
<i>Apparently, that meeting
will be unnecessary.</i>

2296
02:27:10,239 --> 02:27:11,741
<i>Mrs. Hunsaker.</i>

2297
02:27:15,912 --> 02:27:21,167
<i>The joint student-faculty disciplinary
committee needs no further sessions.</i>

2298
02:27:21,250 --> 02:27:23,836
<i>They have come to a decision.</i>

2299
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:28,466
<i>Messrs. Havemeyer, Potter and Jameson
are placed on probation</i>

2300
02:27:29,008 --> 02:27:31,969
<i>for suspicion of ungentlemanly conduct.</i>

2301
02:27:32,261 --> 02:27:35,515
<i>It is further recommended
that Mr. George Willis, Jr.</i>

2302
02:27:35,598 --> 02:27:38,809
<i>receive neither recognition
nor commendation</i>

2303
02:27:38,893 --> 02:27:40,686
<i>for his cooperation.</i>

2304
02:27:42,104 --> 02:27:46,776
<i>Mr. Charles Simms is excused
from any further response to this incident.</i>

2305
02:27:47,193 --> 02:27:48,194
Hoo-ah!

2306
02:27:48,277 --> 02:27:49,820
(ALL CHEERING)

2307
02:28:02,959 --> 02:28:04,418
(INAUDIBLE)

2308
02:28:26,315 --> 02:28:27,900
(EXCLAIMS)

2309
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:49,130
Last step.

2310
02:28:49,213 --> 02:28:51,507
I can always count on you, Charlie.

2311
02:28:54,677 --> 02:28:56,178
MISS DOWNES: Colonel!

2312
02:28:59,724 --> 02:29:01,559
I'm Christine Downes, Colonel Slade.

2313
02:29:01,642 --> 02:29:03,269
I teach political science.

2314
02:29:03,352 --> 02:29:06,772
I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate
you speaking your mind.

2315
02:29:06,856 --> 02:29:08,691
Why, thank you. Are you married?

2316
02:29:08,941 --> 02:29:09,942
(LAUGHS)

2317
02:29:10,026 --> 02:29:11,152
I …

2318
02:29:13,696 --> 02:29:17,241
Went to an artillery school
at Fort Sill with a Mickey Downes.

2319
02:29:17,325 --> 02:29:18,993
Thought he might've snagged you.

2320
02:29:19,076 --> 02:29:21,245
No, I'm afraid not.

2321
02:29:22,913 --> 02:29:26,751
Colonel Slade was on
Lyndon Johnson's staff, Miss Downes.

2322
02:29:26,834 --> 02:29:29,128
Were you? Fascinating.

2323
02:29:29,211 --> 02:29:31,881
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

2324
02:29:35,801 --> 02:29:37,637
Fleurs de Rocaille.

2325
02:29:39,347 --> 02:29:40,473
Yes.

2326
02:29:42,058 --> 02:29:44,185
"Flowers from a brook."

2327
02:29:45,728 --> 02:29:47,188
That's right.

2328
02:29:50,983 --> 02:29:54,820
Well, Miss Downes,
I'll know where to find you.

2329
02:29:56,989 --> 02:29:58,407
Charlie.

2330
02:29:58,491 --> 02:29:59,825
CHARLIE: Bye, Miss Downes.

2331
02:29:59,909 --> 02:30:01,160
MISS DOWNES: Bye.

2332
02:30:04,413 --> 02:30:06,957
You don't have to tell me, Charlie.

2333
02:30:07,541 --> 02:30:08,668
5'7",

2334
02:30:10,252 --> 02:30:12,046
auburn hair,

2335
02:30:13,005 --> 02:30:15,508
beautiful brown eyes.

2336
02:30:34,276 --> 02:30:35,903
Yabba-dabba-doo.

2337
02:30:37,321 --> 02:30:38,447
Ha!

2338
02:30:40,574 --> 02:30:41,742
Manny.

2339
02:30:44,453 --> 02:30:45,913
Oh, Colonel, this is too much.

2340
02:30:45,996 --> 02:30:47,456
Never mind, you earned it.

2341
02:30:47,540 --> 02:30:49,041
Next time Charlie and I

2342
02:30:49,125 --> 02:30:52,128
want to take a breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.

2343
02:30:52,211 --> 02:30:53,879
You can drive us both ways.

2344
02:30:53,963 --> 02:30:55,339
You're on, Colonel.

2345
02:30:55,423 --> 02:30:58,426
Not only will it be an honor,
I'll give you a rate.

2346
02:30:58,509 --> 02:31:01,137
I'll see your rate and raise you.

2347
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:02,972
Stay outta harm's way, Manny.

2348
02:31:03,055 --> 02:31:04,181
Take care, Colonel.

2349
02:31:04,265 --> 02:31:05,558
You, too.

2350
02:31:06,308 --> 02:31:08,811
- Ready?
- No. I'll take it from here.

2351
02:31:09,895 --> 02:31:11,230
You go on ahead.

2352
02:31:11,313 --> 02:31:13,607
Manny'll drive you to your dorm.

2353
02:31:15,025 --> 02:31:17,653
Come by before you go home for Christmas.

2354
02:31:17,737 --> 02:31:19,905
We'll have a little cheer.

2355
02:31:19,989 --> 02:31:22,491
And if you like, stay for dinner.

2356
02:31:22,575 --> 02:31:25,536
Sometimes she cooks a pot roast.

2357
02:31:25,619 --> 02:31:27,288
It's almost edible.

2358
02:31:28,748 --> 02:31:31,292
All right, Colonel. That'd be really …

2359
02:31:31,375 --> 02:31:32,835
Bye, Charlie.

2360
02:31:52,772 --> 02:31:56,442
Who's there? That you, Francine?

2361
02:31:56,525 --> 02:31:57,485
Yes.

2362
02:31:57,568 --> 02:31:58,778
What are you doing?

2363
02:31:58,861 --> 02:32:00,821
Taking a ride.

2364
02:32:00,905 --> 02:32:02,573
Taking a ride?

2365
02:32:02,656 --> 02:32:04,992
What about you giving me a lift?

2366
02:32:05,075 --> 02:32:06,202
No.

2367
02:32:06,285 --> 02:32:07,411
No?

2368
02:32:07,912 --> 02:32:09,705
Come on, Francine.

2369
02:32:10,206 --> 02:32:13,209
We should make up.
Don't you think it's time we made up?

2370
02:32:13,709 --> 02:32:15,002
No.

2371
02:32:15,085 --> 02:32:16,754
- Francine?
- What?

2372
02:32:16,837 --> 02:32:22,134
Uncle Frank's had
a really hard Thanksgiving weekend.

2373
02:32:22,551 --> 02:32:23,719
(KISSING)

2374
02:32:23,803 --> 02:32:26,388
What's that? I hear a chipmunk.

2375
02:32:27,014 --> 02:32:28,891
Is it a walrus?

2376
02:32:29,183 --> 02:32:30,768
No, it's Willie.

2377
02:32:31,185 --> 02:32:33,813
Willie, why don't you help me with my bag?

2378
02:32:33,896 --> 02:32:36,398
Come on, son. Help me with my bag.

2379
02:32:36,690 --> 02:32:38,901
Come on. Come on.

2380
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:42,947
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong. Come on.

2381
02:32:45,282 --> 02:32:46,742
Here we are.

2382
02:32:47,952 --> 02:32:50,538
Francine, come on with me and Willie.

2383
02:32:50,746 --> 02:32:53,457
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow chocolate.

2384
02:32:53,541 --> 02:32:55,251
What do you say?

2385
02:32:55,543 --> 02:32:56,544
Good!
