AUDREY WELLS: The book
Under the Tuscan Sun

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,053
was sent to me early in 2001

3
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,931
to see if I wanted to adapt it
into a screenplay.

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,182
And I was aware of the book.

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,310
I knew it had been a best-seller
for many months.

6
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:24,565
I read it and found that it had
real evocative power for me.

7
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,859
It was a memoir, really,
written by Frances Mayes

8
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,778
about buying a rundown villa
in Tuscany

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,907
and how the process of restoring it
sent her deep into Italian culture.

10
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,702
And it was a dense,
poetic piece of work

11
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:37,953
that was beautiful to read,

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,665
but contained nothing resembling
conventional screenplay structure.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,376
At the time, however, l was
working on an idea of my own

14
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,919
about a woman
overcoming heartbreak.

15
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,506
And I started to realize that these
two stories could be combined.

16
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,718
That I could take the instigating
incident in Frances' book,

17
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,304
buying a villa in Tuscany,
getting a clean slate,

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,847
starting your life in a new way.

19
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:01,435
And I could combine that with the
elements that I had in my other story.

20
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,271
I met Frances Mayes in Tuscany

21
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,399
and she was well aware that
whoever was going to adapt her story

22
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,069
was going to have to bring
something big to the table.

23
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,530
She knew that someone
would need to bring plot,

24
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:17,576
and different characters,
and she was very, very open to that.

25
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,165
And I felt that she trusted me
to capture the essence of her book

26
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,292
in my screenplay adaptation,

27
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,212
because I felt that what the two
would eventually have in common

28
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:32,424
was that they would both
be internal adventure stories.

29
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,760
They would both be about resurrection,
in a sense,

30
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,970
and second chances in life.

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,432
It's true that this
is a pretty loose adaptation.

32
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,560
Most of the characters in the movie
don't exist in the book,

33
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,355
or are only suggested in the book.

34
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,274
And yet, despite the additions,

35
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,319
Frances Mayes ended up feeling
that the essence of her work

36
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:56,532
was well translated to the screen,
and I was very happy about that.

37
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,785
This first scene takes place
in a bookstore

38
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,578
in North Beach of San Francisco.

39
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,038
But in actual fact,

40
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,751
we built this set on a sound stage
at Cinecitta Studios in Rome.

41
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,836
For budgetary reasons,

42
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,421
it worked out better for us
to keep the same crew

43
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,300
and to build all the San Francisco
interiors in Rome.

44
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,719
It meant that I ended up
shooting in San Francisco,

45
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,805
my hometown, only one day.

46
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:25,894
But I feel that we created some
authenticity on those stages in Rome.

47
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,857
I think that bad reviews
should just be forgotten.

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,817
WELLS: lt was important
to me in this scene

49
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,653
to show Diane Lane's character,
Frances,

50
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:39,324
looking her very best, like a woman
in control, a happy woman.

51
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,494
And, ultimately, as we find out,
an unaware woman.

52
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:48,125
I just find that ironic.

53
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,878
Ironic? Why?

54
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,506
Ask your husband.

55
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,970
WELLS: One ofthe things
I looked forward to most

56
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,180
before I started making the movie

57
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:05,893
was the transition between
Diane's face here in this scene,

58
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,688
and the way she looks
when we see her in the next scene.

59
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,566
Here she is innocent.
She doesn't know yet.

60
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,611
And then, when we find her
in the next scene,

61
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,864
and we've leapt forward in time,
we quickly realize

62
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,951
that she knows much, much more
than she knew before.

63
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,789
The way she looks so ravaged in the
following scene is quite devastating.

64
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,333
MAN: Frances.

65
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,460
Frances?

66
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,549
I've got some unfortunate news for you.

67
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,721
WELLS: l wanted Diane Lane
for this part,

68
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,642
because I knew that I was going to be
making an overtly emotional movie.

69
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,645
And that can be a tricky thing to do,
and a risky thing to do.

70
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,230
There are a lot of pitfalls.

71
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,775
And its success lies entirely
on the actress.

72
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,570
And I knew that Diane would have
the authenticity and the bravery

73
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,448
in front of the camera
to carry that off for me.

74
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,995
And also that I could frame this serious
subject matter in a humorous way,

75
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,539
and that with Diane in the main part,

76
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,877
the audience would never lose touch
with the core pain of the character.

77
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,505
That no matter how light I got later on,

78
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,799
Diane would always ground the movie
with her performance.

79
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,469
We would never lose touch
with what we were really dealing with.

80
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,012
$200,000.

81
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,016
-I don't have that kind of money.
-Unfortunately, you do.

82
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,103
The house?

83
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,438
WELLS: This is Jeffrey Tambor
playing the attorney.

84
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,109
It's a tricky thing
trying to cast a really good actor

85
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,610
in a part that only plays one day.

86
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:43,448
Particularly when they have to fly
halfway across the world to do the role.

87
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,075
And I was really happy to get Jeffrey,

88
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,870
because I admire the way he layers his
performances with so much nuance.

89
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,958
He was very impressed with Diane
the day we filmed this scene,

90
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,836
and thought that we should just
keep him as an off-camera voice,

91
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,339
because why cut away from Diane
when she was being so riveting?

92
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,592
And if you let him have it, well,

93
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:07,097
you could end up
with a lot of money in your pocket.

94
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,516
I understand he wants it pretty badly.

95
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,728
Sorry. This is so surreal.

96
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,856
WELLS: Diane came in completely
prepared to film this scene.

97
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,982
She walked onto the set

98
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,444
looking pretty much
exactly as you see her here.

99
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,654
And we only filmed two takes.

100
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,240
This is take one
that I am using in the movie.

101
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,453
My experience with Diane is that she
rarely needed more than three takes

102
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,330
to achieve what we were looking for.

103
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,207
It's near the right schools.

104
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,463
Schools. She's...

105
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,470
Wow.

106
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,640
You're gonna get over this.

107
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,061
WELLS: Here when
Jeffrey Tambor says to her,

108
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,354
"You will get over this, Frances.

109
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,981
"You will.
Some day you will be happy again."

110
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,859
That's the kickoff for the movie,

111
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,235
because we look at that face
and we think,

112
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,988
"No, she will never be happy again."

113
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,242
And that, for me,
established the tension

114
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:13,789
and defined the road
that the movie was going to take.

115
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,832
He says,
"Someday you will be happy again."

116
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,418
We don't believe it.
But we are about to see it happen.

117
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:28,095
I thought it was important to show
the house that Frances lived in,

118
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,973
even though we never see
the ex-husband.

119
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,142
I felt that he would have
more creepy power

120
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,188
if I didn't identify him
with a particular actor playing the part.

121
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,774
I thought leaving him as a sinister ghost

122
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,486
was more powerful for the movie.

123
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,906
But I still wanted to see
what she was leaving behind.

124
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,950
Actually, that painting
that we placed behind her,

125
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,618
you can't really see the whole thing,

126
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,204
but it's a black specter
lurking behind her shoulder,

127
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,123
and I thought that
that represented the husband

128
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,083
on some subconscious way

129
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,253
that only l will ever (LAUGHlNG)
know about.

130
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,428
This action that Diane takes here

131
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,013
is something we came up
with in rehearsal that day.

132
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,267
And later I realized that the gesture
of taking flowers out of a vase

133
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,060
is repeated several times in the movie

134
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,980
by the old man who attends the shrine
outside Bramasole.

135
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,651
Here in this scene, it's a sort
of harbinger of things to come.

136
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,699
We always refer to this location
as the divorce hotel.

137
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,828
That's Jack Kehler, a terrific
character actor, playing the landlord.

138
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,956
The guy crying through the wall
is Matthew Labyorteaux.

139
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,292
He auditioned for me
over the phone in Los Angeles.

140
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,670
He called me up one evening
and sobbed over the telephone for me,

141
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,964
so I could get a feel
for what he would do

142
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,884
when we brought him
onto the looping stage.

143
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,511
Later I found out
that he had played Albert Ingalls

144
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,680
on Little House on the Prairie.

145
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:57,350
It's pretty amazing who you have
access to in Los Angeles.

146
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,395
-What do you do?
-I'm a writer.

147
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,858
So you can help the others
with their suicide notes.

Thanks.

WELLS: We designed this room
to feel like purgatory,

154
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,670
a sort of way station for Frances.

155
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,508
And I had it filled with golf posters
to make it especially depressing.

WELLS: This San Francisco
restaurant interior

158
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:45,357
was actually shot inside a store
called Tod in the center of Rome.

159
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,820
Sandra Oh is the actress that plays
Frances' best friend, Patti.

160
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,031
I never considered another actress
for the part.

161
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,159
I knew Sandra
from my first film, Guinevere,

162
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,663
and I knew that she had
a unique, inimitable presence.

163
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:03,500
It's hard to express
what makes Sandra so special,

164
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,001
but it has something to do

165
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:09,464
with how she manages to project
gravity and levity simultaneously.

166
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,386
I decided to include
a lesbian couple in the movie,

167
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,598
because as I was working
on my theme about heartbreak,

168
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,767
I knew that if I didn't include
a lesbian couple,

169
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,145
I would only be featuring men
breaking women's hearts,

170
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,148
and I think heartbreak
is an equal opportunity killer.

-It changes our plans a little bit.
-Well, of course.

172
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,492
We were about to take a 1 0-day tour
to romantic Tuscany,

173
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,537
but I don't want Patti flying
during her first trimester.

174
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,746
Small sacrifice.

175
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,499
WELLS: When l watch this scene
I am reminded of many happy hours

176
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,211
in front of the Avid
with my editor, Andy Marcus.

177
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,548
A scene like this one, essentially,
it's three talking heads,

178
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,134
can be death without timing.

179
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,053
Andy always brought crispness
to the scenes,

180
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,015
and I think this kind of character-based
editing can be just as challenging

181
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:04,102
as cutting action scenes
that entail thousands of feet of footage.

182
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,605
No. Like that.

183
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,483
-That's your depression speaking.
-Well, it doesn't speak Italian.

184
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,778
It speaks a little high-school French.
Besides, I'm not depressed anymore.

185
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,115
Then what are you still doing living
at Camp Divorce with all those losers?

186
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,076
-Be nice. Those are my people.
-That's not a place you live.

187

Guys, come on.

188
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,789
Thank you so much.

189
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,708
There is no way that I can go

190
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,668

right now, okay?

191
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,130
-I mean, I'm not ready to meet anyone.
-Oh, you won't. That we can assure you.

192
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,214
Oh?

193
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,844
-It's a gay tour of romantic Tuscany.
-Oh.

194
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,680
So it would be very relaxing for you.

195
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,934
Mostly couples, no one would be there
to hit on you or check you out,

196
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,521
and you could just concentrate
and listen to your own inner voice.

197
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:53,401
My inner voice.
My inner voice that would be saying,

198
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,820
"What the fuck am I doing
on a gay tour of Tuscany?"

199
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,074
Frances, it's Italy. Italy.

200
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,701
Plus, you could use it
as a time to start writing.

201

Well, I'm busy.
I have to review all those books, Patti.

WELLS: Post-production on this film,

204
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,382
meaning the picture and sound editing,
was a nonstop pleasure, really,

205
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,427
but production, the actual shoot in Italy
was a much more challenging story.

206
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,264
People have asked me,
with a lot of envy,

207
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,809
what it was like to spend
four months working in Italy.

208
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,562
But that's just the thing. We were
working. It wasn't exactly a vacation.

209
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,692
And there were cultural differences
that we all had to adjust to.

210
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,112
American movie crews
work a guaranteed 12 hours,

211
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,615
and frequently 14 hours,
and they'll work up to 17 hours,

212
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,035
if you make a deal with them
and they want the overtime.

213
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,538
Whereas, ltalian crews
work a 10-hour day

214
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,832
and one to two hours of that is lunch,

215
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,209
and they're really not interested
in earning the overtime.

216
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,670
They want to go home,
they want to watch the soccer game,

217
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,131
they want to participate in their
(CHUCKLING) real lives.

218
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,466
Which is easy to understand
from their point of view,

219
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,803
but difficult for a director
who is trying to accomplish a lot

220
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,847
and finish her scenes.

221
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,727

in San Francisco,

222
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:13,398
the day that you see here,
I shot a 17-hour day.

223
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,692
And it was the longest work day
that we'd ever had on the movie,

224
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,611

with an American crew.

WELLS: The composer on this movie
is Christophe Beck,

234
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,116
and l knew l wanted to work with him,

235
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,619
because we'd worked together
so successfully

236
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,329
on Guinevere, my first film.

237
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,247
And I'd enjoyed my time
with Chris so much

238
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,875
that I was looking forward
to doing it again.

239
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,254
We discussed what we wanted
the music to sound like for this film.

240
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:23,301
We divided it into three strands
that would become a single braid.

241
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,887
One sound would be
a fresh and modern sound,

242
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:30,350
like the one you hear right here,
that would be Frances' music.

243
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,145
Another sound for the movie
would be a more romantic, comedic,

244
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,147
classically Italian sound.

245
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,567
And the last thread
that we wanted to develop

246
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,487
would reference the great composer,
Nino Rota,

247
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,364
who scored all of Fellini's films.

248
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,825
-Now, Frances is straight...
-Aw...

249
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,202
...and she just survived
a terrible divorce,

250
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,413
and according to her friend Patti,
she really needs our support.

251
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:57,252
So, Frances, why don't you stand up
and let everyone say hello?

252

to rain on this day in Florence.

I was making a movie
called Under the Tuscan Sun,

257
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,645
and the weather was rather distressing.

258
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,315
But we decided to make the most of it,
and we got a bunch of red umbrellas.

259
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,192
And it ended up having
kind of a comedic feeling

260
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,279
that the weather was so bad
and stayed bad.

261
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:31,703
This begins the saga of our horrible
historically rainy fall in Tuscany.

262

When it wasn't raining, it was hazy,

263
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,916
and for a while there I was certain

264
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,461

smart enough to get in pre-production

269

We shot these in July.

270
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,060
I was stiII in the United States,

271
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,730

about what I wanted.

272
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,399
And this beautiful shot
we went back to get in May

273
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,650
after I convinced Disney

274
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,653
that I was the woman
making the ugly Tuscany movie.

275
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:10,074
We had some clear days in May
and some crystal clear horizons,

276
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,203
and I felt almost
religiously grateful for that.

277
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,416
The director of photography
that I chose to work with on this movie

278
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,586
is Geoffrey Simpson,
an Australian cinematographer,

279
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,923
who had so many beautiful-looking
movies to his credit.

280
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,342
We ended up
being great partners on this film,

281
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,511
and our approach to the movie
was to shoot in an almost touristic style

282
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,848
when Frances first gets to Italy
and is an outsider.

283
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,184
And then, to use the camera
in a more organic way,

284
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,812
when she has become quite literally
a part of the landscape.

285
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,277
I was very lucky to have Lindsay
Duncan in the role of Katherine,

286
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,612
and when I watch this scene

287
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,614
I remember how concerned
I was that day

288
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,242
about what the character would be
wearing the first time that we saw her.

289
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,119
I wanted her to look outrageous,

290
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,498
but not to seem so strange
that she took us out of the movie.

291
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,041
I remember being tortured this day

292
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,378
about whether or not she should
wear sunglasses and a hat,

293
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,255
orjust sunglasses, orjust a hat.

294
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,300
Those first impressions are
so important.

295
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:13,304
And I was very intent on creating
a believable character here,

296
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,431
despite her outrageousness.

297
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,450
We had two days
to shoot this sequence.

298

The marketplace
and the upcoming postcard montage.

299
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,289
But on the first day,
which started in full sun,

300
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,418
a sleet storm moved in at noon,
and the wind was incredible.

301
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,879
It knocked over all the lights
and tore the roofs off the food stalls.

302
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,007
So we had to wrap
and still finish the scene

303
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,634
in the amount of time originally allotted.

304
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,011

A lot of what you are hearing here
comes from Frances' book, verbatim.

312

And it also established the voice-over

313

later in the movie

00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:52,421
And my casting director, Linda Lowy,
thought that I should meet Lindsay.

338
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:57,051
We asked her to fly out to Los Angeles,
which she did on a Monday.

339
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,220
She flew out
and flew back on the same day,

340
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,056
because Mondays were dark
for her when she was on stage.

341
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,354
I don't even really remember
her reading for the part.

342
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,772
All I had to do was meet Lindsay

343
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,108
and feel her energy to know
that she would be perfect.

WELLS: Sheep are not very good
at taking direction.

346
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,974
We spent an inordinate amount of time

347
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,268
trying to get that bus to roll up
and see the sheep.

348
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,480
It's not the kind of day
that you really enjoy,

349
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,524
because you know the sun
is going down

350
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,401
and we were over schedule
at the time that we shot this,

351
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,404
and had so many more places to go,
and more scenes to get.

352
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,627
Stop the bus.

353
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,588
-Stop the bus.
-What?

WELLS: So now we are
about to discover Bramasole.

355
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,264
And finding this location

356
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,726
was one of the toughest things
that we had to do in pre-production.

357
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,436
We were going to be
shooting in this house

358
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,689
more hours
than in any other location in the movie,

359
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,399
and we didn't have money
to build a set,

360
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,361
so we needed to use
a practical location.

361
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:42,406
And all the houses of that era
have small rooms and low ceilings,

362
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,909
meaning there is no place
to hide the lights,

363
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,536
and there's very little room
to maneuver.

364
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,124
We chose this house because
the ceilings were a little bit higher,

365
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,628
and it was fairly modest in scale,
which was important to me.

366
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,755
I didn't want Frances buying a palazzo

367
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,342

coming close to.

368
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,804
Stephen McCabe,
my production designer,

369
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,223
really led the charge on this house.

370
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,685
He knew that he could make it work,
and he made it very beautiful

371
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,937
when it was completely unimpressive

372
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,314
and actually off-putting
when I first saw it.

00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,202
WELLS: Obviously,
Frances fixing up the house

375
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,455
is some kind of metaphor
for fixing up your life.

376
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,581
It was important to me

377
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,126
that we not make
a home-decorating movie, though.

378
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,922
I really was less interested
in the remodeling aspects of the story

379
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,467
than in anything else, and wanted
to spend very little time on it,

380
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,930
and Steve and l agreed that she
would never really decorate her house.

381
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,058
What we mostly did to indicate
an evolution on the set

382
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,812
was to change the way the rooms
were lit as time went on.

383
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,233
Here in the scene when she first
comes, the curtains are half closed

384
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,153
and you can't see the room
all that well,

385
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,322
or have a real sense of the house yet,

386
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,325
and as the story progresses and she
becomes more at home in Italy,

387
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,162
we started to illuminate the rooms
more brightly and with more warmth.

388
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,166
Why? It didn't get more valuable
in the last five minutes.

389

The contessa feels
that she has asked too little,

390

391
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,172

419

it's a very powerful thing.

504
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,784
I can't believe it.
Why, why did you just say his name?

505
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,954
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I forgot. I'm sorry.

506
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,790

-(RUMBLE OF THUNDER)

507
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,585
Of course I didn't mean I was gonna
do all the work myself. I'm in Italy.

508
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,213
I can hire the muscular descendants

WELLS: l love Diane Lane
and Sandra Oh together.

510
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,092
They had great chemistry

511
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,262
and managed to project
a sense of history onto their friendship.

512
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,889
I also love the way
they looked together physically.

513
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,267
I think they were
exceptionally well matched.

514
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:52,187
And not surprisingly, they remained
friends after the show.

515
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,982
They always had fun on set together,
and it made it easy for them

516
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,652
to come up with wonderful improvs
like this bit that Sandra added here.

517

-Can you star-69 Italy?
-No.

518
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,366
I'm gonna try.

00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,495
Hello?

520
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,667
Okay.

521
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:20,924
WELLS: This is the first day of shooting
here, and in some ways it was difficult,

522
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,970
because we had effects,
we had wind, we had rain.

523
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,433
We were actually
shooting during the day,

524
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,978
which meant
that the location was tented.

525
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,439
But it was good for Diane
to have something really active

526
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,608
to do on day one.

527
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,151
It's always hard to break the ice,

528
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,111
and the physical demands of this scene

529
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,697
helped Diane lose the inhibitions
of the first day.

530
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,118
Diane really had to trust me

531
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,454
that I was going to put some
scary lightning out those windows,

532
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:55,626
because she was making the face of
someone who was completely terrified.

533
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,297
This washing machine here,

534
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,633
it's being moved along
by somebody pulling a string.

535
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,719
And then, there is an air gun
in a hole underneath it

536
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,930
that makes itjump up into the air.

537
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:12,351
We shot it with two cameras
running at two different speeds.

538
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,728
And, boy,
that was really exciting for me.

539
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,439
Two cameras, you know.
Michael Bay, watch out.

540
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,983
This owl was much better
at taking direction

541
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,402
than the sheep or the scorpions.

542
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,073
I think he has got a great spirit.

543
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,910
And I like the way Diane
connects to other solitary animals.

544
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,663
There was some kind of
method to my madness here.

545
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,707
I feel like animals have a lot of pathos.

546
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:39,002
And, obviously,
their greatest interest is in surviving.

547
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,088
And Frances' survival instinct

548
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,674
needs to kick in
at this time of her life also.

549
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,343
And I felt that she had a kinship,

550
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,680
a relationship to all the solitary animals
that show up in the movie.

551
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,770
Vince Riotta, who plays Signor Martini,

552
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:01,900
he was not a very well-known actor
when I was introduced to him

553
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,320
by Beatrice Kruger,
my Italian casting director.

554
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,114
And in some ways, I think,

555
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,825
the thing that scared me the most
on this movie was casting Vince.

556
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,369
Because I didn't see
any other film on him.

557
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,496
I only had his auditions to go on.

558
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:21,545
And they were so perfectly pitched,
that I felt that I had to go with him.

559
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,304
As a man, Vince is a young,

560
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:35,517
kind of boyish guy
with a lot of youthful energy,

561
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:40,522
and the restrained, reserved,
wizened man

562
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,399
that he plays in this movie

563
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,985
is entirely a performance
that he created.

564
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,280
Oh, wonderful.

565
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:52,910
You should have been an architect.
You have excellent taste.

566
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,828
So, do you think it can be done?

567
00:31:55,622 --> 00:32:00,417
Heating pipes, a week.
The bathrooms, three days.

568
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,503
Signora, give me the keys of this place

569
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,882
and in one month I will give you back
the keys to your palace.

570
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,842
Just...

571
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,763
Just leave it to me.

WELLS: ln this montage
with all the contractors

573
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,184
I think about my casting directors

574
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,269
and how important they were to me.

575
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,650
A director can only choose actors

576
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,778
from amongst the group
that the casting director brings.

577
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,489
And those two were so creative

578
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,158
and had such a good sense
of the script

579
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:37,913
that I owe them a lot for finding
me actors like the ones that I did.

580
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:42,960
This is Massimo Sarchielli right here
who'd been in a lot of Fellini's movies.

581
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,879
I was thrilled to have an alumnus
of La Strada in my movie.

582
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:50,050
Really? Oh.
You wanna see the rest of the house?

WELLS: Finding the three actors
who would play the Polish contractors

585
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,146
was one of the biggest casting
challenges of the film.

586
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,857
And finding a young,
beautifully fresh-faced actor

587
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,902
who could speak Polish and handle
physically demanding scenes

588
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,529
was especially difficult.

589
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:14,408
Finding Pawel Szajda was like
finding a needle in a haystack.

590
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:18,328
He is an American, actually,
born to Polish immigrant parents.

591

And he sent us an audition tape
that he made all alone.

00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,000
He turned the camera on
and ran in front of it

to off-camera voices.

594

WELLS: l tried to cast my Polish guys
from Poland.

608
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,893
But the Italians were being slow
about approving work permits

609
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,562
for Polish people to come
and work in Italy,

610
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,230
which seemed very ironic to me,

611
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,232
because, in a sense,
the Polish characters

612
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:34,071
represent the plight of the immigrant
worker anywhere in the world.

613
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,947
And here we were having
so many problems

614

bringing people from Poland into Italy,

615
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,535

getting work permits

616

from other parts of the world.

617

When l look at this scene,

618
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,254
I remember all the plaster dust that all
the actors had to swallow that day.

619
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:55,801
And considering that it was the first
working day for the Polish guys,

620
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,971
(LAUGHING) l think they all considered
quitting after one day of work.

621
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:05,936
The fact that I didn't have real
Polish actors to play the Polish workers

622
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,647
meant that later on in post-production

623
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,524
I had to add in some dialogue in Polish

624
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:14,528
once we'd had time
to have Polish-speaking people

625
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,279
teach us some words.

626
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:21,952
And in Los Angeles one day a guy
came to fix my stove that had broken,

627
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,247
and I started talking to him
and it turned out he was Polish.

628
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,374
I asked him if he could
come into the studio

629
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,752
and record some
temporary dialogue for us, and he did.

630
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,839
l think he's got his SAG card now.
No more ovens for him.

FRANCES: "Kurwa mac" means
"holy shit" in Polish.

I learned that that day.

00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,557
The fact that I'm trying
to speak Polish in Italy

634
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,768

WELLS: Valentine Pelka's
character, Jerzy,

637

had the most mystery
of all the Polish workers.

00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,700
And in keeping with my idea

639
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,161
that I would give everyone in the movie
a broken heart,

640
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,205
I had decided that Jerzy
should wear a wedding ring,

641
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,208
meaning he had had
to leave his beloved in Poland.

642

Valentine is also married,

643
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,671

who were back home in England,

644

in the clouds enough hours

That actress is Giulia Steigerwalt,

the perfect counterpart to Pawel.

They are both very young actors.

675

They were both 20 years old

676

They had some
genuine innocence to them.

I don't really know how they'd feel
about my saying that,

678

in each of them

679

She was already in her 90s
when she agreed to take this part,

692
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:09,137
and she'd been an actress all of her life

She had her own way of doing things.

She couldn't exactly
do lines as written,

695
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:21,900
but she had such a significant
presence because of her age, I think,

696
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:26,654

so that she could be in them

physical ability at the time.

any English,

706

So we were always talking
to each other through interpreters.

And I don't know
that she really ever knew

709
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,571
what the movie was about, or read
the whole script or anything like that,

710
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:13,743
but she knew that it was her part
to care about love and defend love,

711
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,913
and she felt very passionate
on that topic.

712

Celibe in Italian means single.

735
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,985
is quite obviously in the spirit
of Fellini's women.

736
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,653
The costume designer, Nicoletta,

737
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:35,158
dressed her in replica costumes
from some of Fellini's films.

738
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:40,038
And this fantastic hat ended up flying
into the fountain the night that we shot.

As you can see, it's very windy

onto her head well enough.

the hat flew off into the fountain

there was some touch and go time

FRANCES: A train track through
the Alps before there was a train.

838
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,963
Signor Martini wants me to have faith,

839
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,298
something I've never been good at...

840
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,926
WELLS: This image is called
the Running Madonna.

841
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,554
When I reached Italy,
my assistant Edoardo Petti,

842
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:15,224
who later became
an associate producer on the movie,

843
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,476
he told me about this tradition

844
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,812
that existed elsewhere in Italy,
not in Tuscany,

845
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,647
but we borrowed it for the film.

846
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,195
I included this painting
by Piero della Francesca,

847
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,740
because he is native of Tuscany,

848
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,283
and because
that image of the Madonna

849
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,912
protecting even the sinners I thought
would be important to Frances.

850
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,039
FRANCES: Aunt Mary is
everywhere here,

851
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,166
her calm presence assuring us

852
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,586
that all things will go on
as they have before.

853
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,423
WELLS: This Christmas scene
made me feel like a real movie director.

854
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:51,260
We had snow. We had extras.
We had a manger.

855
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,095
You know,
what more could you ask for?

856
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,806
Just about everybody in this scene
is recognizable to me,

857
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,142
because Cortona
was such a small town

858
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:01,103
and everybody who lived there
wanted to be an extra in the movie,

859
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,773
and so the people that you see
crossing back and forth here

860
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:07,109
were also really the people
working in the cafes

861
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,738
and at the hair salon
and in the grocery stores.

862
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,117
Bellissima.

863
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,995
What a beautiful family. Wow.

864
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,538
WELLS: When l watch this scene

865
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,667
I am reminded that we had
a lot of snow issues that night.

866
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:26,462
We had a very noisy snow machine
for covering the entire piazza.

867
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:30,716
And I had asked that we find a way
to have snow fall on actors quietly

868
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,760
when we were in their close-ups,

869
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,721
but this quiet way
never exactly materialized,

870
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,975
and the machines that we did have
would've drowned out their dialogue,

871
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,560
and I would've had to replace it all later.

872
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:45,314
So, instead, l settled on having guys
off-camera throw snow into the air

873
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,817
and fan it in the actors' direction.

874
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:52,071
This was quieter, but as you can see,
it was also, shall we say, inconsistent.

875
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,741
There are so many compromises
that you make along the way.

876
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,329
-Merry Christmas, Signora Mayes.
-Buon Natale.

877
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,250
WELLS: Frances Mayes, in her book,
talks a lot about food.

878
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,213
It's a very important element
of Italian life.

879
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:12,091
And Frances, as a poet,
writes about it in such a way

880
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,926
that food takes on a lot

881
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,887
of other kinds of significance.

882
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,348
And I had decided early on

883
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:24,186
that I wasn't going to try and make
a great movie about cooking.

884
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,564
There are some fantastic movies
about cooking,

885
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,358
like Eat Drink Man Woman
or Like Water for Chocolate.

886
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,527
Those are movies
that made it very clear to me

887
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,030
that I wasn't going to try and do that.

888
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:38,159
I had too much story to tell
to center the movie around food.

889
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,494
It wasn't the way I'd structured the film.

890
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,748
And I thought that a little
would go a long way.

891
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,959
So this is pretty much the only time

892
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,962
you see a lot of cooking
going on in the movie.

893
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,257
I like the fact that she feeds
her immediate family,

894
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,509
the guys that she sees every day.

895
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,261
And the food that you see here

896
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:00,598
was prepared by Antonella
from Tonino's Restaurant,

897
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,266
it's a place that we loved to eat

898
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,227
and where they were very,
very nice to us during the shoot.

899
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,146
We would always go there
on Friday nights.

900
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,232
And they would bring out dish
after dish after dish,

901
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,068
each one more delicious than the last,

902
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,820
and for me,
I took a lot of pleasure out of it,

903
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,906
because I was really working
such long hours

904
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,618
going to the dailies after shooting,
and we were shooting six-day weeks,

905
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,621
and when we went to Tonino's
every now and then and had a meal,

906
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:26,248
that was a real moment of relaxation
for us all.

907
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,338
Bravo!

908
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,218
Bravo! Bravo!

Riusciro, riuscirai, riuscira, riusciremo,
riuscirete, riusciranno.

910
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,854

-See, Frances? Italian is easy.

911
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,109
WELLS: It's true that I co-authored
the screenplay

912
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:56,946
for George of the Jungle,
but this is not an homage to moi.

913
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,491
I knew that I wanted to stick
an American movie out there,

914
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,536
and since my film was
for the Walt Disney Company,

915
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,288
I chose a film from their library
to make life simple.

916
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,458
And itjust seemed funny to me
to have Pawel say outside,

917
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,418
"See, Frances, ltalian is easy."

918
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,004
And then to see that even George
of the Jungle could speak Italian.

00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:23,389
Si. I have talked to her.

If you tried to recreate that somewhere,

you would never come up with
something as fantastic as that facade.

This set we dressed with furniture,

00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,772
but the walls are original
from Napoleon's era.

933
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:18,319
As a matter of fact, Napoleon
actually slept in this room, so they said.

934

-I think I'll come back another time.

939
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,129
from the fabric that is covering them.

00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,174
Although the CGl guys
did a very good job.

941
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,259
You see, what happened here

942
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:45,763
is that I was contractually obligated
to deliver a PG-13 movie.

943
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:51,143
And originally that actor
came out with a nude butt.

944
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,646
And I received an R rating for the film,

945
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,190
even though
actually the scene is very innocent.

946
00:53:56,775 --> 00:54:00,236
So in order to roII that back to PG-13,

947
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,821
we decided to put some underwear
on Zeus' bum.

948

move accordingly.

was probably starting to feel
claustrophobic in that environment,

968
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:08,387

1005
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,674

gentlemanly person.

-You are too late.
-I'm sorry?

1010

liked each other a lot.

1013

And it was always fun
having the two of them together.

1014
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,909
They had a good rapport.

1015
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,953
And I especially liked the way

1016
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,665
Raoul had a charming
and kind of trustworthy presence.

1017
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:47,045
He didn't seem like the typical
Latin lover, wolf-whistling,

1018
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,797
sleaze ball kind of guy.

1019
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,884
I felt that I understood
why Diane's character

1020
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,343
would be attracted to him

1021
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,180

afterjust having met him.

1022

-Is it far?
-About three hours.

1023
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:05,189
-Two, if I drive fast.

WELLS: When Frances meets MarceIIo,

1025

it's clearly something
the audience has been waiting for.

1026
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,281
Ever since Patti said,
"Have you met him yet,

1029
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:24,333
And I felt like it's also part and parcel
with stories about people on the road.

1030
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,919
It's the kind of time
when you are open to things,

1031

and you have adventures
and you let yourself talk to strangers.

1032

And I like the adventurous aspect of it.

1033
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,596
But more than that,
this was an opportunity for me

1034
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,517
to show her coming back to life
and taking chances.

1035
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,686

in an unconventional manner
later on in the movie.

1039
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,866
It was a chance to sort of
play with some stereotypes

1040

and make fun of them at the same time.

1041

The comedy was very important
in order to accomplish that.

And this is one of the most famous
stretches of road in the world.

1048

This piece of music
is one of the first things

1049
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,396
that Chris wrote for the movie.

1050
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,065
And he didn't write it
for any scene in particular.

1051
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,651
And it was so romantic,
I wanted to find a place for it,

1052
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,319
but wasn't sure that I would.

1053
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,531
Then we realized
that it suited this drive very nicely.

1054
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:43,328
Once again, we hadn't made the
proper sacrifices to the weather gods,

1055
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:47,040
because we were absolutely dogged
by rain when we were in Positano.

1056
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,002
You are barely seeing
any complete takes here,

1057
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,087
because we always had to stop

1058
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,840
when it would suddenly begin raining
and we'd start over again.

1059
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:59,219
It's miraculous that this sequence
comes off as looking somewhat sunny

1060
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,014
when, in fact, we were getting
rained out every 10 minutes.

We are a family. I work here.

there was a day

1065

that Raoul and I spent together.

1066
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,034
And we had some lunch
and then, afterwards,

1067
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,871
he poured me a glass of limoncello,
the liqueur made from lemons

1068
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,497
that come from the south of Italy.

1069
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,750
And he told me
that he knew how to make it.

1070
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:32,252
And I asked him
to explain that process to me.

1071
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,088
And as he did, l realized that

1072
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:38,258
I was looking
at a rather intoxicating person

1073
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,969
who was in the middle
of a pretty sensuous description

1074
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,304
of how these things are made.

1075
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:45,140
And I thought it was funny, actually,

1076
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,725
and that it really
needed to go in the movie.

1077
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,436
That it could be something
that he could do with Frances

1078
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,022
that could unsettle her
and make her smile.

1079
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:55,859
So I told Raoul
that when we got to Positano,

1080
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:59,196
I would ask him to tell Frances
how limoncello was made,

1081
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,781
but that I would never write the scene

1082
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,991
and he should
never rehearse the scene,

1083
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:07,245
that he should just let it go
from his mind and do it on the day.

1084
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,166
I love the way it turned out.
I think Diane helped a little bit

1085
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,919

under the table.

the umbrellas looked on the beach,

This scene is very playful

but it's an absurdity
that I recognize from life.

There's a certain giddiness
that exists between people

about to happen.

1098

01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:13,979
and it's so colorful,
I thought we could make it work.

1335
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:17,233
Whoo!

1336
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:41,382
Yay! Bravo!

1337
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:45,219
WELLS: Here once again, we used
the latest special effects technology

1338
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:47,054
to achieve our ends.

1339
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,014
Somebody stood on a ladder

1340
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:51,600
and dropped a Styrofoam pole
on Pawel's head.

1341
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:03,237
We had two days to shoot this scene
and three cameras.

1342
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,365
And, as always, my ally in this scene

1343
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,909
was my director of photography,
Geoffrey Simpson.

1344
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,040
-I threw the flag.
-Si, amore.

1345
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,838
They're fine.

1346
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,507
Let's go.

1347
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:29,930
WELLS: GeoffSimpson wasn't
the only important cameraman

1348
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,348
working on the movie for me.

1349
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,934
Because the other one
was my husband,

1350
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:36,937
who shot
a lot of the second unit material,

1351
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,148
like this landscape shot right here.

1352
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:54,163
Francesca, you see my daughter.
She seems so different.

1353
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:55,539
Really?

1354
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,958
-Chiara is not herself.
-Oh.

1355
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:01,545
Maybe... Do you know
what's bothering her?

1356
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:04,882
Placido, I don't know.

1357
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:09,386
Hey, Frances, look.
You can see Bramasole from here.

1358
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,263
See?

1359
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,140
Thank you.

1360
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:25,903
WELLS: Diane was always game
for whatever was required of her.

1361
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:29,615
She threw herself into things
wholeheartedly.

1362
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:31,909
And that included the physical comedy.

1363
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:36,872
I really had a good time watching her
the day that we shot this scene.

1364
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:40,042
The way she tore off down that hill.

1365
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:45,631
And when it was time
to fall down the muddy embankment,

1366
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:50,177
she did it with such abandon that
we only did a second take for safety,

1367
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,638
because the first one was so hilarious.

1368
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:00,771
Arh...

1369
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:05,568
Wait!

1370
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,282
Marcello!

1371
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,371
WELLS: Sometimes when
l watch a scene in the film,

1372
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:19,623
I still remember
the shooting day vividly.

1373
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:20,875
And when l watch this scene,

1374
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:23,419
I remember that I had a migraine
the day that we shot this.

1375
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,337
And that we were
working on a Saturday,

1376
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:28,883
which meant that the crew was only
going to work seven straight hours,

1377
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:32,052
and that then they were going to leave
come hell or high water.

1378
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,762
And it was a big scene to get done

1379
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:36,223
and not the only one
that we had scheduled for the day.

1380
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:39,894
And I remember
everybody starting to pack up to leave

1381
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:44,273
while Sandra was still trying
to come up with her performance

1382
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:46,066
for the last beat of this scene

1383
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,320
when she admits
that she is already in labor.

1384
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:53,449
When l look at it,
I remember really how mad I was.

1385
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:57,411
(CHUCKLING) But like so many
other days of shooting on the film,

1386
01:21:57,495 --> 01:22:00,247
the behind-the-scenes action
didn't really manifest onscreen.

1387
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:04,168
You could've tied him to a chair,
you could've crippled him!

1388
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,171
You could've faked labor, at least!

1389
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:10,716
I wouldn't have had to fake it.

1390
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,011
WELLS: l remember that even
the night before

1391
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:17,014
we were scheduled to shoot the scene,
we still didn't have a baby

1392
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:20,976
to play Patti's infant
that was of a believable weight.

1393
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,645
And I was very nervous
about finding one

1394
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,271
that was young enough
and small enough

1395
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:25,856
to be convincing as a newborn.

1396
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:30,861
This baby was born to a couple
in Rome that was on set that day.

1397
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:34,657
And I remember the very quiet
and reverent atmosphere on set

1398
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,158
as they stood behind the camera

1399
01:22:36,242 --> 01:22:40,245
nervously watching their infant
being passed from actress to actress.

1400
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:43,207
We didn't really
have Florence out the window.

1401
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,750
That's a green screen effect.

1402
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:47,252
So Diane wasn't really
about to heave-ho.

1403
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:54,051
The pink ribbons on the door,
that's a tradition in Italy

1404
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:56,428
that I was unaware of
until I started scouting.

1405
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:59,306
It's something that they do
to announce the arrival of a baby.

1406
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,892
And I thought it was a nice addition
to the scene.

1407
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,937
Okay...

1408
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,400
You're so cute, you're so cute!

1409
01:23:10,026 --> 01:23:11,652
WELLS: This flower design
on the ground

1410
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:14,238
is part of something called an infiorata,

1411
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:18,409
a festival where people make fantastic
living tapestries on the ground.

1412
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:21,161
And my regret is that
we were so pushed for time that day

1413
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,331
that I had to move on
before I got my wide shot.

1414
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:27,626
And I still haven't really let go
of my disappointment over that.

1415
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:31,046
Still, l think that the sequence works.

1416
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,506
A baby is born,
the spring flowers bloom,

1417
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:35,009
and the house is coming back to life.

1418
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,225
Frances?

1419
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:47,855
We are finished.

1420
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:57,614
WELLS: l think it's very tender,
this scene.

1421
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,825
The Polish guys have
become Frances' family,

1422
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:02,661
and their work is done
and it's time for them to leave.

1423
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:06,248
There was a detail
in Frances Mayes' book

1424
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:10,377
in which the Polish workers
wrote the word "Polonia" on a stone

1425
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:13,005
that they placed
near the bottom of her finished wall.

1426
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:14,590
And I found that very touching.

1427
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:21,597
I like the way the different actors
handle a scene.

1428
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:26,018
I like Valentine's reserve
and continued dignity here.

1429
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:28,562
I like the way Pawel smiles and laughs

1430
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:30,898
kind of in counterpoint
to the emotion of the scene.

1431
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:36,195
l had suggested to Sasa
that he might cry in this scene.

1432
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:39,073
And this is what he did with it.

1433
01:25:07,018 --> 01:25:10,521
The traditional structure
of romantic comedy, or human comedy

1434
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:14,274
as this film is, is that things reach
their low point at the end of Act 2.

1435
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:16,318
There is always, at least in my writing,

1436
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:18,320
a point at which the comedy
slows down

1437
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:22,032
and the needs of the characters
in their most sincere form take over.

1438
01:25:22,575 --> 01:25:24,034
And we worry about Frances here.

1439
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,286
Because we see that,
despite all her efforts,

1440
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:27,538
she still feels alone.

1441
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:56,483
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

1442
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:03,740
I had always hoped that these boxes
of books would come as a surprise.

1443
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,493
That we had forgotten about them
and that to see them now

1444
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,078
would have a certain punch to it.

1445
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,665
And the blue vase
functions as a hot object,

1446
01:26:11,749 --> 01:26:14,918
meaning an object
that carries a lot of emotional value

1447
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:17,713
and symbolism for my main character.

1448
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,770
This photograph represents
the only time

1449
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,939
that we actually see
Frances' ex-husband.

1450
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:40,235
I thought that creating a moving image
inside the Polaroid

1451
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,030
would evoke her visceral memory
of what it was like

1452
01:26:43,114 --> 01:26:44,323
when she used to feel loved.

1453
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:46,575
She looks at that photo

1454
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:49,912
and she knows urgently
that she has to move on.

1455
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:57,544
I love what Chris Beck did
with the music here,

1456
01:26:57,629 --> 01:27:00,088
creating the anticipation
for the cut to the next scene.

1457
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:10,557
One hour before l got this shot,

1458
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,143
that stone pier
was completely underwater.

1459
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:15,854
And every time I see the shot,
I feel incredibly grateful

1460
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:19,107
that Diane wasn't knocked over
by a wave and dragged out to sea.

1461
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:21,235
The fact that Diane
didn't worry about her safety

1462
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,903
is one of the reasons that I love her.

1463
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:25,113
She always wanted the shot
as much as I did.

1464
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:31,411
This sequence
on the back of the motorbike

1465
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:34,081
was shot in about 20 frantic minutes

1466
01:27:34,165 --> 01:27:36,416
while most of the crew
was packing to leave Positano

1467
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:37,834
when the sun was going down.

1468
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:41,338
Johnny got it on his Steadicam
sitting on the back of a Polaris.

1469
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:48,178
And once again, Diane eschewed
safety and didn't wear a helmet,

1470
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,847
so that we could see all that
beautiful hair flowing in the wind.

1471
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:57,646
There were a lot of challenges
getting this scene done.

1472
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:01,275
For one thing, we all thought that
Raoul Bova's fans would show up,

1473
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,110
and we were afraid that
we would be surrounded

1474
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:06,113
by a thousand young women
screaming, "Raoul, Raoul."

1475
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:08,198
But, fortunately, they didn't materialize.

1476
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:12,119
But even without the fans,
this was a tough shooting day.

1477
01:28:12,745 --> 01:28:14,705
We battled the elements
getting this scene.

1478
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:17,040
The clouds were
moving incredibly fast.

1479
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,377
And every take went in and out
of sun every 30 seconds.

1480
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:24,381
Geoff was calling out F-stop changes
while the actors were performing.

1481
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:27,843
And it rained maybe six times
during Diane's coverage.

1482
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:30,929
And PAs kept running out
with umbrellas to shield her.

1483
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:35,475
Plus we were on a tiny road
that was the only road out of Positano.

1484
01:28:35,768 --> 01:28:37,269
And when we weren't
stopping for the sun,

1485
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:38,895
we were stopping to let the traffic out.

1486
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:41,273
It was stressful for the actors.

1487
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:42,899
And when we were done shooting,

1488
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:45,944
I was unconvinced
that the scene would ever cut.

1489
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:49,573
And the fact that it works
is due to Geoff's quick reactions,

1490
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,909
my editor and the color timer
at Technicolor, Lee Wimer.

1491
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:56,413
I sent her a really good bottle of wine
after this.

1492
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:04,880
Wow, I...

1493
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,051
I came at a bad time.

1494
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:12,012
Francesca, wait. Wait. Wait.

1495
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:15,098
I'm sorry you're hurt.
But what did you expect?

1496
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,184
What did I expect?

1497
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,354
You came to Bramasole.
You left that note.

1498
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:23,565
-I thought... I thought that you...
-Just a minute, just a minute.

1499
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:25,776
Months ago, we had a beautiful affair.

1500
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,195
WELLS: The dialogue in this scene
was a little tricky to write.

1501
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:30,530
It's an inherently melodramatic scene,

1502
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,367
but there is truth in it, l think,
and that's what saves it.

1503
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,204
Of course, Frances' affair
with the fantasy man can't work out.

1504
01:29:37,288 --> 01:29:40,374
And if it had, this movie
would've been entirely different,

1505
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:42,459
with a different meaning
and a different tone.

1506
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:46,713
As it is, the scene shows,
l think, a realistic end

1507
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:49,257
to what was essentially
an unrealistic affair.

1508
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:51,802
There was my friend,
and she was going to have a baby...

1509
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:54,513
There were many, many other things.

1510
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:59,226
Important things you had to do.

1511
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:02,646
And you couldn't wait.

1512
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:06,233
WELLS: I didn't want Raoul's character
to end up as the bad guy.

1513
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:10,278
I tried to construct dialogue
that was fair to both characters.

1514
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:14,157
And I think what Marcello is saying
in this scene has integrity.

1515
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:17,953
Raoul felt that his character
was full of sincere regret.

1516
01:30:18,704 --> 01:30:20,789
We did about seven takes on Raoul

1517
01:30:20,873 --> 01:30:23,417
with the clouds blowing wildly
across the sun,

1518
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:26,336
but each take was
wonderfully nuanced

1519
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:27,712
and sort of heartbreaking.

1520
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:29,673
There is someone for you, Francesca.

1521
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,437
Goodbye.

1522
01:30:51,487 --> 01:30:52,863
Francesca.

1523
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:15,385
WELLS: This scene, which we just
called "the fountain scene,"

1524
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:18,180
was the one I was most concerned
about pulling off.

1525
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:20,557
Asking an actress to do her impression

1526
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:23,602
ofAnita Ekberg in La Dolce Vita
is a tall order.

1527
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:25,103
It was really pretty risky.

1528
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:28,732
And I knew that we'd be referencing
one of the most famous love scenes

1529
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:31,318
in cinema history. It's not the kind
of thing you want to get wrong.

1530
01:31:32,111 --> 01:31:35,489
But Lindsay,
with the costuming help of Nicoletta,

1531
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:36,823
she really pulled it off.

1532
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,034
It had been freezing and windy as hell.

1533
01:31:39,118 --> 01:31:40,744
But for some reason,
it warmed up that night

1534
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:42,621
and the air was completely still.

1535
01:31:42,705 --> 01:31:44,873
And I remember feeling that
that was a good omen.

1536
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,086
Is she drunk?

1537
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:53,507
WELLS: We dressed Vince in a
black suit like Marcello Mastroianni.

1538
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:56,635
And I think he and Diane
have perfect comic timing here.

1539
01:31:58,095 --> 01:32:00,764
Chris Beck's score also
gives the scene a lot of help.

1540
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,266
He composed something
very eerie and beautiful

1541
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:06,520
that was very much related
to the kind of scores

1542
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:08,563
that Nino Rota did for Fellini.

1543
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:15,987
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

1544
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:20,033
Then, of course,
there is the fountain itself,

1545
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:23,537
which l think is Stephen McCabe's
crowning achievement in the film.

1546
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,248
There was no fountain
in the Piazza Signorelli in Cortona,

1547
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:28,542
and Steve knew
that I wanted something

1548
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:32,504
in a heroic classical form
like the Trevi Fountain in Rome.

1549
01:32:33,464 --> 01:32:37,384
He designed this statue and we built it
from scratch out of fiberglass.

1550
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,053
That's the royal "we," of course,

1551
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:42,639
because I personally
didn't get my hands dirty.

1552
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:48,061
When the fountain was first installed,
the town was scandalized to see

1553
01:32:48,145 --> 01:32:51,314
that the male figure sported an
anatomically proportionate package,

1554
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:55,110
and it caused such a scandal
that the local paper

1555
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:57,237
accused me of being
a Communist sympathizer,

1556
01:32:57,321 --> 01:32:58,905
because the statue hung left.

1557
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:01,283
At which point,
l decided to order a reduction,

1558
01:33:01,367 --> 01:33:03,618
which I heard was carried out
under the cover of night.

1559
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:08,832
Do you think I make a good Sylvia?

1560
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:11,126
You were wonderful.

1561
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,673
Here.

1562
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:21,428
WELLS: This is the scene that makes
Katherine's character work for me.

1563
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:24,973
Without this scene,
Katherine is an eccentric

1564
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:28,184
who suffers some kind
of narcissistic delusions.

1565
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:31,104
But with this scene,
we realize that Katherine

1566
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:35,900
has made a conscious choice to live
in her flamboyant and grand style.

1567
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:38,778
She is not a marginal,

1568
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:43,366
almost psychotic person
caught in fantasies and delusions,

1569
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:46,953
she is a real woman
who has made decisions

1570
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:48,955
about how she is going to handle pain
in her life.

1571
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,417
And how she is going
to incorporate joy.

1572
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:57,172
And here with the monologue
that she has at the end of the scene,

1573
01:33:57,256 --> 01:33:59,382
I think we really understand
what makes her tick.

1574
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:09,976
You know who I really love the most
from all the films?

1575
01:34:10,936 --> 01:34:12,395
Cabiria.

1576
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,775
You remember at the end,

1577
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:20,987
when another man has left her
in the most terrible way,

1578
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:24,032
and she thinks it's all over for her?

1579
01:34:25,576 --> 01:34:30,997
Then she sees some children
playing in the street, making music,

1580
01:34:32,249 --> 01:34:36,920
and before she knows it,
she's smiling again.

1581
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:42,550
That's what Fefe always said,

1582
01:34:43,969 --> 01:34:46,429
"No matter what happens,

1583
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:52,268
"always keep your childish innocence.

1584
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:57,941
"It's the most important thing."

WELLS: When Frances
returns to the house,

1586
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:19,462
we see that the entryway
has remained the same

1587
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:22,048
since the day
that she first arrived at Bramasole.

1588
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:25,009
It signals that the house
is still incomplete,

1589
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:27,178
as is Frances' journey.

1592
01:35:36,105 --> 01:35:39,941
WELLS: I think Frances is almost
frighteningly miserable in this scene.

1593
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:44,446
She's reached her lowest
and most faithless moment.

1594
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:48,116
But that's also when everything
can start turning around for her.

1595
01:35:50,035 --> 01:35:52,495
Stupid. Stupid.

01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,999
WELLS: Once again,
I think we only shot this scene twice.

1597
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:59,419
Diane doesn't need to do something
like this over and over.

1598
01:35:59,503 --> 01:36:03,131
The very first time she does it,
she is entirely emotionally prepared.

(SOBBING OUTSIDE)

1600
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,044
This is the scene
that almost didn't happen.

1601
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:43,505
It was our very last day of shooting.

1602
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:45,548
And we worked from maybe

1603
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:47,967
4:00 in the afternoon
until 4:00 in the morning.

1604
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:52,180
EveIina Gori,
the grandmother character,

1605
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:55,141
she had had a heart attack
about six weeks earlier

1606
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:57,936
after having shot most of her scenes.

1607
01:36:59,271 --> 01:37:01,940
There were people who felt
that she should not return to work,

1608
01:37:02,024 --> 01:37:05,068
that she shouldn't be in this scene
and she shouldn't complete the movie.

1609
01:37:05,903 --> 01:37:08,613
I felt differently about it.
If Evelina was up for it,

1610
01:37:08,697 --> 01:37:12,242
I wanted to fight to keep her
in the scene and not to rewrite it.

1611
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:15,829
I respected her a lot,
she'd been an actress her entire life.

1612
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:19,415
And we both felt that this might be
her last role before she retired.

1613
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:22,418
And I thought it was important
that she complete the movie

1614
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:26,381
for me, of course, and for the film.
But also, out of respect for Evelina.

1615
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:33,263
The fact that she could only
come to work on this particular day,

1616
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:37,016
this last day, conflicted
with Anita Zagaria's schedule,

1617
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,185
that's the actress that plays the mother.

1618
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:41,563
And she was working
on another movie that day

1619
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:43,356
and couldn't start until the afternoon.

1620
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,943
Diane had been fulfilling commitments
on Unfaithful

1621
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:50,864
in England that weekend and had to
fly back for this last day of shooting.

Everyone was tired.
Tensions were high.

From personal experience?

WELLS: When l first wrote this scene
and I realized that by the end of it

1632
01:38:25,357 --> 01:38:28,568
Frances was going to claim Pawel
as part of her family,

1633
01:38:28,819 --> 01:38:31,487
the themes of the film
really gelled for me.

1634
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:33,156
I thought it was meaningful

1635
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,909

for the happiness of others

01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:37,493
even in the midst of her misery.

1637
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:40,663

she was creating her salvation,

1645
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:22,413
WELLS: We looked at a lot of churches

1646
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:26,417
before I decided on this
relatively unadorned medieval one.

1647
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:30,254
This interior, by the way,
is not the interior of the church

1648
01:39:30,339 --> 01:39:31,923
that you saw in the exterior shot.

1649
01:39:33,258 --> 01:39:36,719
This one had a purity and a symmetry
about it that really appealed to me

1650
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,888
more than the baroque churches
that we looked at.

1651
01:39:39,264 --> 01:39:41,432
And the piece of music
that you are hearing

1652
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:44,394
was the first thing
that Chris scored for the movie.

1653
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:49,357
He created this piece

1654
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:52,110
months before he started
working on the rest of the film.

1655
01:39:52,194 --> 01:39:54,779
And I played it while we were shooting.

1656
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:57,740
It really created the mood
inside the church

1657
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:00,743
and helped the actors
come up with their performances.

1658

Diane said that
with that piece of music,

1659

she really didn't have to do
any work of her own

01:40:19,221 --> 01:40:20,304
Amen.

1665
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,265
ll sangue di Cristo.

1666
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:24,350
Amen.

1667
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:30,023
ll sangue di Cristo.

1668
01:40:30,107 --> 01:40:31,566
Amen.

1669
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:46,998
WELLS: l felt a lot ofaffection
for the characters in this movie.

1670
01:40:47,499 --> 01:40:50,084
And this is
an admittedly traditional wrap-up

1671
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:51,919
going on at this wedding reception.

1672
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:54,422
We are getting a lot of final glimpses

1673
01:40:54,506 --> 01:40:56,883
of characters
that we came to care about.

1674
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:01,596
Visually, we designed
the wedding reception

1675
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:05,308
around white and yellow,
the colors of the lemons and wisteria.

1676
01:41:05,434 --> 01:41:07,185
And it feels like
the garden and the house

1677
01:41:07,269 --> 01:41:09,604
have finally arrived at their full fruition.

1678
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:11,981
Mamma!

1679
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:18,780
(GUESTS CHANT)
Bacio! Bacio! Bacio! Bacio!

1680
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:22,575
WELLS: There is an undeniable
sweetness to this scene,

1681
01:41:22,659 --> 01:41:26,871
particularly when Frances
sees her old friend, Signor Martini.

1682
01:41:28,999 --> 01:41:30,875
He looks like a groom standing there

1683
01:41:30,959 --> 01:41:33,336
waiting for her to walk down the aisle
to meet him.

1684
01:41:33,962 --> 01:41:35,963
What are you thinking?

1685
01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:39,592
WELLS: Their friendship is one
of my favorite things in the movie.

1686
01:41:39,676 --> 01:41:40,718
It's been earned.

1687
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:44,138
And when he points out
that her wishes have been granted,

1688
01:41:44,223 --> 01:41:46,974
there is a sweet melancholy feeling
of arrival to that

1689
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:48,643
that reminds me
of the kind of resolution

1690
01:41:48,727 --> 01:41:50,186
you find in an O. Henry story.

1691
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,115
Yeah.

1692
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:05,201
And you said you wanted
there to be a family here.

1693
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:14,293
You're right.

1694
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:17,463
I got my wish.

1695
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:20,383
WELLS: l love Diane's performance
as she realizes

1696
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:22,927
that she has, indeed,
gotten everything she's asked for.

1697
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:26,055
She seems stunned
and sort of quietly amazed.

1698
01:42:45,075 --> 01:42:46,409
ln the book Under the Tuscan Sun,

1699
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,078
Frances Mayes is married to Ed Mayes

1700
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:52,373
and she writes about him
on almost every page of her memoir.

1701
01:42:54,042 --> 01:42:57,253
I thought it was important
for my adaptation

1702
01:42:57,337 --> 01:43:00,506
that I bring Ed Mayes
into the story somewhere

1703
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:03,092
and here he is,
played by David Sutcliffe.

1704
01:43:06,763 --> 01:43:10,433
But in my mind, I didn't think
she necessarily ended up with this guy.

1705
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,352
I didn't put her in a wedding dress.
I didn't get her pregnant,

1706
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:15,771
which would've been a denial
of what came before.

1707
01:43:16,148 --> 01:43:17,231
I just wanted to show that

1708
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:20,526
once she had achieved a sense
of completion on her own,

1709
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:23,321
and once she realized that she, indeed,

1710
01:43:23,405 --> 01:43:25,156
already had everything she needed,

1711
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,909
that then she was open
for more good things to come her way.

1712
01:43:29,494 --> 01:43:31,037
No, no.

1713
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:36,626
Don't worry. It was by far the very best
bad review I've ever received.

1714
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:38,628
-You're kidding.
-I'm not.

1715
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:41,672
It helped me get to my next book.

1716
01:43:42,257 --> 01:43:45,218
Anyway, I've been traveling
around Tuscany.

1717
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:48,721
Someone said that you lived up here,
and...

1718
01:43:51,391 --> 01:43:54,393
WELLS: Eversince l became
a screenwriter 15 years ago,

1719
01:43:54,811 --> 01:43:59,106
I've been warned and admonished
about too many endings on movies.

1720
01:43:59,983 --> 01:44:03,361
And I think that this movie
may have more endings

1721
01:44:03,445 --> 01:44:06,364
than any movie
I've ever seen in my life.

1722
01:44:06,448 --> 01:44:10,743
But it works for me. It feels like
all the dominoes were lined up.

1723
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:13,371
Now I flick the first one with my finger

1724
01:44:13,455 --> 01:44:16,916
and they all start to fall
with satisfying clacks.

1725
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:27,885
FRANCES: They say they built
the train tracks

1726
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:30,096
over the Alps
between Vienna and Venice

1727
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:33,391
before there was a train
that could make the trip.

1728
01:44:33,475 --> 01:44:35,309
They built it anyway.

1729
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:38,604
They knew one day
the train would come.

1730
01:44:40,232 --> 01:44:42,900
Any arbitrary turning along the way,

1731
01:44:42,985 --> 01:44:47,154
and l would be elsewhere,
I would be different.

1732
01:44:48,865 --> 01:44:53,202
What are four walls, anyway?
They are what they contain.

1733
01:44:53,328 --> 01:44:55,955
The house protects the dreamer.

1734
01:44:56,039 --> 01:45:00,584
Unthinkably good things can happen,
even late in the game.

1735
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:03,004
It's such a surprise.

1736
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:11,304
WELLS: There is an inevitability
to what happens in this scene.

1737
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:16,225
But I've always felt that unpredictability
is an overrated virtue in movies.

1738
01:45:16,476 --> 01:45:20,521
Especially in romantic comedies
or human comedies like this one,

1739
01:45:20,605 --> 01:45:22,732
unpredictability isn't really
part of the genre.

1740
01:45:23,191 --> 01:45:24,817
We know we are headed
for a happy ending.

1741
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:28,070
And we want to go there.
Of course, the ending is predictable.

1742
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:30,906
It's not the fact that it happens

1743
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:33,326
that's supposed to be
the source of pleasure.

1744
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:37,830
It's how it happens and how the actors,
how the characters react

1745
01:45:37,914 --> 01:45:39,749
and the impact that it has upon them.

1746
01:46:09,237 --> 01:46:10,446
(LAUGHING)

1747
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:18,245
The water here is a sort of baptism
as it washes her feet.

1748
01:46:19,289 --> 01:46:22,792
The look on her face seems
somehow transcendent.

1749
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:25,961
Someone once told her
that one day she'd be happy again,

1750
01:46:26,046 --> 01:46:29,215
and here she realizes
that that person was right.
