we have arrived...</i>

77
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:46,511
<i>...at the very first bridge
of the evening.</i>

78
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:49,547
<i>Now, I have a question.</i>

79
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:52,847
<i>Does anyone here know
the lyrics to this bridge?</i>

80
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:55,388
<i>- Prove it!</i>

81
00:04:55,388 --> 00:04:57,588
<i>I'm drunk
in the back of the car</i>

82
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,349
<i>And I cried like a baby
coming home from the bar</i>

83
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:01,658
<i>Oh</i>

84
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:03,220
<i>Said, "I'm fine"
But it wasn't true</i>

85
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,157
<i>I don't wanna keep secrets
just to keep you</i>

86
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:09,160
<i>And I snuck in
through the garden gate</i>

87
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,360
<i>Every night that summer
just to seal my fate</i>

88

<i>Oh</i>

89
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,605
<i>And I screamed
for whatever it's worth</i>

90
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,035
<i>"I love you"</i>

91
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:18,169
<i>Ain't that the worst thing
you ever heard?</i>

92
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:20,446
<i>He looks up
grinning like a devil</i>

93
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,339

130
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:12,442

131
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:14,785

<i>I mean,</i>

135
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:53,252
<i>you're making me feel...</i>

136
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:57,058
<i>like I get to play

<i>at SoFi Stadium tonight.</i>

138
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,083
<i>I guess what I'm trying
to say is</i>

139
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,447
<i>you're making me feel like
I'm</i> The Man.

140
00:09:27,352 --> 00:09:28,958
<i>I would be complex</i>

141
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:31,829
<i>I would be cool</i>

142
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:33,292
<i>They'd say
I played the field</i>

143
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:36,295
<i>Before I found
someone to commit to</i>

144
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:38,132
<i>And that would be okay</i>

145
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:39,738
<i>For me to do</i>

146
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:42,367
<i>Every conquest I had made</i>

147
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:44,842
<i>Would make me
more of a boss to you</i>

148
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:48,340
<i>I'd be a fearless leader</i>

149
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,375
<i>I'd be an alpha type</i>

150

<i>When everyone believes ya</i>

151
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,181
<i>What's that like?</i>

152
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:58,823
<i>I'm so sick of running
as fast as I can</i>

153
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:00,484
<i>Wondering if I'd get there quicker</i>

154
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:02,959
<i>If I was a man</i>

155
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,061
<i>And I'm so sick of them
coming at me again</i>

156
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,558
<i>'Cause if I was a man</i>

157
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,132
<i>Then I'd be the man</i>

158
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:13,101
<i>- I'd be the man
- Man</i>

159
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,369
<i>- I'd be the man
- Man</i>

160
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,077
<i>They'd say I hustled</i>

161
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:24,310
<i>Put in the work</i>

162
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,674
<i>They wouldn't
shake their heads</i>

163
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:28,677
<i>And question
how much of this I deserve</i>

164
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:30,085
<i>What I was wearing</i>

165
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,054
<i>If I was rude</i>

166
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,551
<i>Could all be separated</i>

167
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,422
<i>From my good ideas
and power moves</i>

168
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,227
<i>And they would
toast to me, oh</i>

169
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:42,361
<i>- Hey!
- Let the players play</i>

170
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,331
<i>I'd be just like Leo</i>

171
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:46,772
<i>In Saint-Tropez</i>

172
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,973
<i>I'm so sick of running
as fast as I can</i>

173
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:53,009
<i>Wondering if I'd get there quicker</i>

174
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,242
<i>If I was a man</i>

175
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:58,542
<i>And I'm so sick of them
coming at me again</i>

176
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,951
<i>'Cause if I was a man</i>

177
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,382
<i>Then I'd be the man</i>

178
00:11:03,382 --> 00:11:05,549
<i>- I'd be the man
- Man</i>

179
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:09,729
<i>- I'd be the man
- Man</i>

180
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,897
<i>What's it like
to brag about</i>

181
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:14,294
<i>Raking in dollars</i>

182
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:16,527
<i>And getting
bitches and models</i>

183
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:18,529
<i>And it's all good
if you're bad</i>

184
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,729
<i>And it's okay
if you're mad</i>

185
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:22,907
<i>If I was out
flashing my dollars</i>

186
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:24,975
<i>I'd be a bitch, not a baller</i>

187
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,076
<i>They'd paint me out
to be bad</i>

188
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:30,046
<i>So it's okay that I'm mad</i>

189
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:43,653
<i>I'm so sick of running
as fast as I can</i>

190
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:45,424
<i>Wondering if I'd get there quicker</i>

<i>If I was a man</i>

192
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:50,803
<i>And I'm so sick of them
coming at me again</i>

193
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:54,004
<i>'Cause if I was a man</i>

194
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,468
<i>- Then I'd be the man</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

195
00:11:56,468 --> 00:12:00,769
<i>I'm so sick of running
as fast as I can</i>

196
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,771

<i>'Cause if I was a man</i>

200
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,254
<i>Then I'd be the man</i>

201
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:15,388
<i>- I'd be the man</i>
<i>Man</i>

202

<i>- I'd be the man

<i>Then I'd be the man</i>

207
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:56,869
<i>You are somebody
that we don't know</i>

208
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:59,234
<i>But you're coming
at my friends like a missile</i>

209
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:00,565
<i>Why are you mad?</i>

210
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:03,337
<i>When you could be GLAAD?</i>

211
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,570
<i>GLAAD</i>

212
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,507
<i>Sunshine on the street
at the parade</i>

213
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:10,476
<i>But you would rather be
in the dark ages</i>

214
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:12,181
<i>Making that sign</i>

215
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,986
<i>Must've taken all night</i>

216
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,355
<i>You just need
to take several seats</i>

217
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:22,719
<i>And then try
to restore the peace</i>

218
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,193
<i>And control your urges
to scream</i>

219
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:26,459
<i>About all the people
you hate</i>

220
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,859
<i>'Cause shade never made
anybody less gay so</i>

221
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:36,073
<i>So, oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

222
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:37,635
<i>You need to calm down</i>

223
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:40,374
<i>You're being too loud</i>

224
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:43,674
<i>And I'm just like
oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

225
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:47,018
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh</i>

226
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:50,021
<i>You need to just stop</i>

227
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:52,617
<i>Like, can you just
not step on his gown?</i>

228
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:54,289
<i>You need to calm down</i>

229
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:57,127
<i>And we see you over there
on the Internet</i>

230
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,756
<i>Comparing all the girls
who are killing it</i>

231
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,527
<i>But we figured you out</i>

232
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:04,233
<i>We all know now
We all got crowns</i>

233
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:07,566
<i>- You need to calm down
- Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

234
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:09,975
<i>Let me see your hands!</i>

235
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,471
<i>You need to calm down</i>

236
00:14:12,903 --> 00:14:14,342
<i>You're being too loud</i>

237
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:17,741
<i>And I'm just like
oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

238
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:21,217
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh</i>

239
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:22,812
<i>You need to just stop</i>

240
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:24,220
<i>Can you stop?</i>

241
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,783
<i>Like, can you just
not step on our gowns?</i>

242
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,587
<i>You need to calm down</i>

243
00:14:58,289 --> 00:14:59,992
<i>It is</i>

244
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:03,655
<i>an honor and a delight
to say these words to you.</i>

245
00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:06,130
<i>Welcome to
The Eras Tour.</i>

246
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,702
<i>I mean, look at you, though.</i>

247
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:20,045
<i>Like, look at what I get
to play with tonight.</i>

248
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,806
<i>I get to sing with you,
and dance with you,</i>

249
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:24,313
<i>and vibe with you,</i>

250
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:26,282
<i>and hang out with you
all night. Look at you.</i>

251
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:28,878
<i>- You know,</i>

252
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:32,717
<i>we get a good sense of a crowd
in the first couple of songs.</i>

253
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:34,191
<i>We realize if
it's going to be</i>

254
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:36,028
<i>like a soulmate crowd situation,</i>

255
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:38,888
<i>and it feels so promising,
I just have to
tell you that.</i>

256
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,692
<i>It's looking so good.</i>

257
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:49,140
<i>So you and I,</i>

258
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,076
<i>we're about to go on
a little adventure together.</i>

259
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:54,706
<i>And that adventure is going
to span 17 years of music,</i>

260
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:58,083
<i>and it's going to be
one era at a time.</i>

261
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,349
<i>- How does that sound to you?</i>

262
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,586
<i>All right,
so let me tell you</i>

263
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:08,654
<i>my secret little dream
for this evening.</i>

264
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:10,689
<i>So these are songs</i>

265
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:13,362
<i>that I have written
about my life</i>

266
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:15,265
<i>or things I felt
at one point in time</i>

267
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,497
<i>whether I was a teenager,</i>

268
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:19,665
<i>in my 20s,
or a couple years ago,</i>

269
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:21,535
<i>but after tonight,
when you hear these songs</i>

270
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:23,174
<i>out and about in the world,</i>

271
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:26,243
<i>my dream is that you're gonna
think about tonight</i>

272
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:29,004
<i>and the memories we made
here together at SoFi Stadium.</i>

273
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:31,842
<i>I'll be your host
this evening.</i>

274
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:33,712
<i>My name is Taylor.</i>

275
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:35,516
<i>Thank you for traveling
with us here
at The Eras Tour.</i>

276
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:41,489
<i>We could leave
the Christmas lights
up till January</i>

277
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:48,562
<i>This is our place
We make the rules</i>

278
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,060
<i>And there's a dazzling haze</i>

279
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,173
<i>A mysterious way
about you, dear</i>

280
00:16:58,145 --> 00:17:02,609
<i>Have I known you
20 seconds or 20 years?</i>

281
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:10,485
<i>Can I go where you go?</i>

282
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:16,623
<i>Can we always be this close?</i>

283
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:19,461
<i>Forever and ever, and, ah</i>

284
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:23,102
<i>Take me out
and take me home</i>

285
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:30,835
<i>You're my, my, my, my</i>

286
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,507
<i>Lover</i>

287
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:45,388
<i>We could let our friends
crash in the living room</i>

288
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:50,987
<i>This is our place
We make the call</i>

289
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:55,332
<i>And I'm highly suspicious</i>

290
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:58,665
<i>That everyone who sees you
wants you</i>

291
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:03,098
<i>I've loved you
three summers now, honey</i>

292
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:05,903
<i>But I want 'em all</i>

293
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:14,384
<i>- Can I go where you go?</i>

294
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:19,653
<i>Can we always be this close?</i>

295
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:22,491
<i>Forever and ever, and, ah</i>

296
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:26,165
<i>Take me out
and take me home</i>

297
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:28,563
<i>Forever and ever</i>

298
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:34,096
<i>You're my, my, my, my</i>

299
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:36,241
<i>Lover</i>

300
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,068
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand?</i>

301
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:42,841
<i>With every guitar string
scar on my hand</i>

302
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:49,848
<i>I take this magnetic force
of a man to be my lover</i>

303
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:53,258
<i>My heart's been borrowed
and yours has been blue</i>

304
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:56,558
<i>All's well that ends well
to end up with you</i>

305
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:03,598
<i>Swear to be overdramatic
and true to my lover</i>

306
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:05,028
<i>And you'll save</i>

307
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:09,670
<i>All your dirtiest jokes for me</i>

308
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:15,874
<i>And at every table
I'll save you a seat</i>

309
00:19:15,874 --> 00:19:17,744
<i>Lover</i>

310
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:23,486
<i>Can I go where you go?</i>

311
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:29,426
<i>Can we always be this close?</i>

312
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:32,627
<i>Forever and ever, and, ah</i>

313
00:19:32,627 --> 00:19:36,532
<i>Take me out
and take me home</i>

314
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:38,468
<i>Forever and ever</i>

315
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:44,969
<i>You're my, my, my, my</i>

316
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:51,613
<i>Oh, you're my, my, my, my</i>

317
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:57,949
<i>Oh, darling
You're my, my, my, my</i>

318
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,886
<i>Lover</i>

319
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:51,508
<i>There's something
about the way</i>

320
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:54,203
<i>The street looks
when it's just rained</i>

321
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:56,843
<i>There's a glow
off the pavement</i>

322
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:58,779
<i>You walk me to the car</i>

323
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:03,718
<i>And you know I wanna
ask you to dance right there</i>

324
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:07,458
<i>In the middle
of the parking lot</i>

325
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,591
<i>Yeah</i>

326
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:20,163
<i>We're drivin' down the road</i>

327
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:22,869
<i>I wonder if you know</i>

328
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:27,577
<i>I'm trying so hard
not to get caught up now</i>

329
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,579
<i>But you're just so cool</i>

330
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,076
<i>Run your hands
through your hair</i>

331
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:37,015
<i>Absentmindedly makin' me want you</i>

332
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:41,987
<i>And I don't know
how it gets better than this</i>

333
00:21:41,987 --> 00:21:46,662
<i>You take my hand and drag me
headfirst, fearless</i>

334
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:51,865
<i>And I don't know why
but with you I'd dance</i>

335
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:56,408
<i>In a storm in my best dress Fearless</i>

336
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,949
<i>Well, you stood there
with me in the doorway</i>

337
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:14,558
<i>My hands shake
I'm not usually this way</i>

338
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,288
<i>But you pull me in
and I'm a little more brave</i>

339
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:21,928
<i>It's the first kiss
it's flawless</i>

340
00:22:21,928 --> 00:22:24,128
<i>Really somethin'</i>

341
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:28,000
<i>It's fearless</i>

342
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:35,139
<i>Oh, oh, oh, yeah</i>

343
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:41,915
<i>And I don't know
how it gets better than this</i>

344
00:22:41,915 --> 00:22:46,458
<i>You take my hand and drag me
headfirst, fearless</i>

345
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:51,892
<i>And I don't know why
but with you I'd dance</i>

346
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:56,160
<i>In a storm in my best dress Fearless</i>

347
00:22:57,966 --> 00:22:59,262
<i>Oh, oh</i>

348
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:01,605
<i>Oh, oh, yeah</i>

349
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:16,752
<i>All right, L.A.,
are you ready</i>

350
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:18,281
<i>to go back
to high school with me?</i>

351
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,287
<i>You're on the phone
with your girlfriend</i>

352
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:25,794
<i>She's upset</i>

353
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:29,358
<i>She's going off about
something that you said</i>

354
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:34,572
<i>She doesn't
get your humor like I do</i>

355
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:37,971
<i>I'm in my room</i>

356
00:23:37,971 --> 00:23:40,512
<i>It's a typical Tuesday night</i>

357
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:44,208
<i>I'm listening to the kind
of music she doesn't like</i>

358
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:49,554
<i>And she'll never
know your story like I do</i>

359
00:23:51,085 --> 00:23:54,823
<i>But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts</i>

360
00:23:54,823 --> 00:23:58,827
<i>She's cheer captain
and I'm on the bleachers</i>

361
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:02,160
<i>Dreaming about the day
when you wake up and find</i>

362
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,493
<i>That what you're looking for
has been here the whole time</i>

363
00:24:05,493 --> 00:24:08,199
<i>If you could see
that I'm the one</i>

364
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,904
<i>Who understands you</i>

365
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:15,745
<i>Been here all along
So, why can't you see?</i>

366
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:21,377
<i>You belong with me</i>

367
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:28,824
<i>Walk in the streets with you
in your worn-out jeans</i>

368
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:32,520
<i>I can't help thinking
this is how it ought to be</i>

369
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,359
<i>Laughing on a park bench
thinking to myself</i>

370
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,329
<i>Hey, isn't this easy?</i>

371
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:40,935
<i>And you've got a smile</i>

372
00:24:40,935 --> 00:24:43,498
<i>That can light up
this whole town</i>

373
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:47,238
<i>I haven't seen it in a while
since she brought you down</i>

374
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:50,681
<i>You say you're fine
I know you better than that</i>

375
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:53,882
<i>Hey, what you doing
with a girl like that?</i>

376
00:24:53,882 --> 00:24:57,952
<i>She wears high heels
I wear sneakers</i>

377
00:24:57,952 --> 00:25:01,285
<i>She's cheer captain
and I'm on the bleachers</i>

378
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:04,695
<i>Dreaming about the day
when you wake up and find</i>

379
00:25:04,695 --> 00:25:08,292
<i>That what you're looking for
has been here the whole time</i>

380
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:11,130
<i>If you could see
that I'm the one</i>

381
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,703
<i>Who understands you</i>

382
00:25:12,703 --> 00:25:18,709
<i>Been here all along
So, why can't you see?</i>

383
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:23,615
<i>You belong with me</i>

384
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:27,311
<i>Standing by
and waiting at your back door</i>

385
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:28,785
<i>All this time</i>

386
00:25:28,785 --> 00:25:33,449
<i>How could
you not know, baby?</i>

387
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:38,795
<i>You belong with me</i>

388
00:25:51,304 --> 00:25:54,745
<i>Oh, I remember you
driving to my house</i>

389
00:25:54,745 --> 00:25:56,571
<i>In the middle of the night</i>

390
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:58,309
<i>I'm the one
who makes you laugh</i>

391
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:00,410
<i>When you know
you're 'bout to cry</i>

392
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,115
<i>I know your favorite songs</i>

393
00:26:02,115 --> 00:26:03,655
<i>And you tell me
'bout your dreams</i>

394
00:26:03,655 --> 00:26:05,789
<i>Think I know
where you belong</i>

395
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:09,452
<i>Think I know it's with me</i>

396
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:12,191
<i>Can't you see
that I'm the one</i>

397
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:13,621
<i>Who understands you?</i>

398
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:19,671
<i>Been here all along
So, why can't you see?</i>

399
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:24,632
<i>You belong with me</i>

400
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:28,438
<i>Standing by
and waiting at your back door</i>

401
00:26:28,438 --> 00:26:29,780
<i>All this time</i>

402
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,213
<i>How could
you not know, baby?</i>

403
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:39,889
<i>You belong with me</i>

404
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:44,553
<i>You belong with me</i>

405
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:49,393
<i>Have you ever thought
just maybe</i>

406
00:26:49,393 --> 00:26:54,563
<i>You belong with me</i>

407
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,600
<i>We were both young
when I first saw you</i>

408
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,076
<i>I close my eyes
and the flashback starts</i>

409
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:36,781
<i>I'm standin' there</i>

410
00:27:38,312 --> 00:27:41,885
<i>On a balcony in summer air</i>

411
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:45,614
<i>See the lights</i>

412
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:48,188
<i>See the party
The ball gowns</i>

413
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:51,521
<i>See you make your way
through the crowd</i>

414
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:54,062
<i>- And say, "Hello"</i>

415
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:58,330
<i>Little did I know</i>

416
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,808
<i>That you were Romeo
You were throwin' pebbles</i>

417
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:07,306
<i>And my daddy said
"Stay away from Juliet"</i>

418
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:10,309
<i>And I was cryin'
on the staircase</i>

419
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:14,247
<i>Beggin' you
"Please don't go"</i>

420
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,249
<i>And I said</i>

421
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:20,286
<i>Romeo, take me
somewhere we can be alone</i>

422
00:28:20,286 --> 00:28:22,486
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

423
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:24,488
<i>All there's left to do
is run</i>

424
00:28:24,488 --> 00:28:28,459
<i>You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess</i>

425
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:33,101
<i>It's a love story
Baby, just say, "Yes"</i>

426
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:40,471
<i>So I sneak out
to the garden to see you</i>

427
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:42,110
<i>We keep quiet</i>

428
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,815
<i>'Cause we're dead
if they knew</i>

429
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:45,641
<i>So close your eyes</i>

430
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:52,186
<i>Escape this town
for a little while, oh oh</i>

431
00:28:52,186 --> 00:28:56,190
<i>'Cause you were Romeo
I was a scarlet letter</i>

432
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,930
<i>And my daddy said
"Stay away from Juliet"</i>

433
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,262
<i>But you were everything
to me</i>

434
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:06,728
<i>I was beggin' you
"Please don't go"</i>

435
00:29:07,236 --> 00:29:08,840
<i>And I said</i>

436
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,470
<i>Romeo, take me
somewhere we can be alone</i>

437
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,769
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

438
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:16,540
<i>All there's left to do
is run</i>

439
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,984
<i>You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess</i>

440
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:25,054
<i>It's a love story
Baby, just say, "Yes"</i>

441
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,957
<i>Romeo, save me</i>

442
00:29:26,957 --> 00:29:29,157
<i>They're tryna tell me
how to feel</i>

443
00:29:29,157 --> 00:29:32,996
<i>This love is difficult
But it's real</i>

444
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:34,492
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

445
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:37,066
<i>We'll make it
out of this mess</i>

446
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:41,499
<i>It's a love story
Baby, just say, "Yes"</i>

447
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:46,911
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

448
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:58,923
<i>I got tired of waiting</i>

449
00:30:00,223 --> 00:30:03,994
<i>Wonderin' if you were
ever comin' around</i>

450
00:30:03,994 --> 00:30:08,724
<i>My faith in you was fading</i>

451
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:12,002
<i>When I met you
on the outskirts of town</i>

452
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:13,366
<i>And I said</i>

453
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:17,370
<i>Romeo, save me
I've been feeling so alone</i>

454
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,209
<i>I keep waiting for you
but you never come</i>

455
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:24,872
<i>Is this in my head?
I don't know what to think</i>

456
00:30:24,872 --> 00:30:26,918
<i>He knelt to the ground</i>

457
00:30:26,918 --> 00:30:29,580
<i>And pulled out a ring
And said</i>

458
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,219
<i>"Marry me, Juliet</i>

459
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,452
<i>"You'll never
have to be alone</i>

460
00:30:33,452 --> 00:30:37,258
<i>"I love you
and that's all I really know</i>

461
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:41,592
<i>"I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress</i>

462
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:48,005
<i>"It's a love story
Baby, just say, 'Yes'"</i>

463
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:51,569
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

464
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:55,672
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

465
00:30:57,445 --> 00:31:04,318
<i>'Cause we were both young
when I first saw you</i>

466
00:31:48,034 --> 00:31:52,630
<i>Wait for the signal</i>

467
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:59,340
<i>And I'll meet you
after dark</i>

468
00:32:13,356 --> 00:32:14,553
<i>I'm like the water</i>

469
00:32:14,553 --> 00:32:17,061
<i>When your ship
rolled in that night</i>

470
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:20,196
<i>Rough on the surface</i>

471
00:32:20,196 --> 00:32:23,034
<i>But you cut through
like a knife</i>

472
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:28,138
<i>And if it was
an open-shut case</i>

473
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:30,899
<i>I never would've known
from the look on your face</i>

474
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:34,903
<i>Lost in your current
like a priceless wine</i>

475
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:39,413
<i>The more that you say
The less I know</i>

476
00:32:39,413 --> 00:32:42,383
<i>Wherever you stray
I follow</i>

477
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:45,386
<i>I'm begging for you
to take my hand</i>

478
00:32:45,386 --> 00:32:48,884
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

479
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,094
<i>Life was a willow</i>

480
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:52,492
<i>And it bent
right to your wind</i>

481
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,692
<i>Oh</i>

482
00:32:54,692 --> 00:32:58,927
<i>Head on the pillow
I could feel you sneaking in</i>

483
00:33:00,964 --> 00:33:03,569
<i>As if you were
a mythical thing</i>

484
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:06,737
<i>Like you were a trophy
or a champion ring</i>

485
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:10,213
<i>And there was one prize
I'd cheat to win</i>

486
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:15,284
<i>The more that you say
The less I know</i>

487
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,188
<i>Wherever you stray
I follow</i>

488
00:33:18,188 --> 00:33:20,949
<i>I'm begging for you
to take my hand</i>

489
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:24,128
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

490
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:27,054
<i>You know that my train
could take you home</i>

491
00:33:27,054 --> 00:33:29,430
<i>Anywhere else is hollow</i>

492
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,532
<i>I'm begging for you
to take my hand</i>

493
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:35,964
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

494
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:40,210
<i>Life was a willow</i>

495
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,740
<i>And it bent
right to your wind</i>

496
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,116
<i>Oh</i>

497
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:48,152
<i>They count me out
time and time again</i>

498
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:51,749
<i>Life was a willow</i>

499
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:54,158
<i>And it bent
right to your wind</i>

500
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,490
<i>Oh</i>

501
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,955
<i>But I come back stronger
than a '90s trend</i>

502
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:27,488
<i>Wait for the signal</i>

503
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:30,018
<i>And I'll meet you
after dark</i>

504
00:34:31,692 --> 00:34:36,464
<i>Show me the places where
the others gave you scars</i>

505
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:40,996
<i>Now this is
an open-shut case</i>

506
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:44,032
<i>Guess I should've known
from the look on your face</i>

507
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:47,640
<i>Every bait and switch
was a work of art</i>

508
00:34:49,677 --> 00:34:52,513
<i>The more that you say
The less I know</i>

509

523
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,622
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

524
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,295
<i>Hey, that's my man</i>

525
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,122
<i>That's my man</i>

526
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:44,026
<i>Yeah, that's my man</i>

527
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:46,699
<i>Every bait and switch
was a work of art</i>

<i>I'm begging for you
to take my hand</i>

531
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:58,876
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

532
00:36:14,993 --> 00:36:19,732
<i>Never be so kind
You forget to be clever</i>

533
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:29,973
<i>Never be so clever
You forget to be kind</i>

534
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:38,388
<i>And if I didn't know better</i>

535
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:42,920
<i>I'd think you were
talking to me now</i>

536
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:47,925
<i>If I didn't know better</i>

537
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:53,271
<i>I'd think
you were still around</i>

538
00:36:55,198 --> 00:37:00,102
<i>What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead</i>

539
00:37:00,102 --> 00:37:05,074
<i>You're alive
You're alive in my head</i>

540
00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:10,178
<i>What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead</i>

541
00:37:10,178 --> 00:37:12,950
<i>You're alive, so alive</i>

542
00:37:14,657 --> 00:37:17,152
<i>The autumn chill
that wakes me up</i>

543
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,363
<i>You loved the amber skies
so much</i>

544
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:21,497
<i>Long limbs
and frozen swims</i>

545
00:37:21,497 --> 00:37:24,797
<i>You'd always go past
where our feet could touch</i>

546
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:27,030
<i>And I complained
the whole way there</i>

547
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,472
<i>The car ride back
and up the stairs</i>

548
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,035
<i>I should've
asked you questions</i>

549
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:35,775
<i>I should've
asked you how to be</i>

550
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:38,140
<i>Asked you
to write it down for me</i>

551
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,011
<i>Should've kept
every grocery store receipt</i>

552
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:45,554
<i>'Cause every scrap of you
would be taken from me</i>

553
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,183
<i>Watched as you signed
your name Marjorie</i>

554
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,285
<i>All your closets
of backlogged dreams</i>

555
00:37:51,285 --> 00:37:55,157
<i>And how you left them all
to me</i>

556
00:37:55,157 --> 00:38:00,294
<i>What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead</i>

557
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:05,299
<i>You're alive
You're alive in my head</i>

558
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:10,172
<i>What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead</i>

559
00:38:10,172 --> 00:38:13,010
<i>You're alive, so alive</i>

560
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:18,422
<i>And if I didn't
know better</i>

561
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:22,921
<i>I'd think you were
singing to me now</i>

562
00:38:25,352 --> 00:38:28,091
<i>If I didn't know better</i>

563
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:33,063
<i>I'd think
you were still around</i>

564
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:38,508
<i>I know better</i>

565
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:42,776
<i>But I still feel you
all around</i>

566
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,781
<i>I know better</i>

567
00:38:50,082 --> 00:38:52,280
<i>But you're still around</i>

568
00:39:21,146 --> 00:39:25,115
<i>You know, this...
this tour,</i>

569
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:26,457
<i>the fact that this is</i>

570
00:39:26,457 --> 00:39:29,823
<i>the last city
on the U.S. tour...</i>

571
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:32,155
<i>It is...</i>

572
00:39:32,155 --> 00:39:35,059
<i>It is so, so many things
for me, because this has been</i>

573
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:38,502
<i>the most extraordinary experience
of my entire life.</i>

574
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:39,800
<i>Being on this tour,</i>

575
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,000
<i>getting to share these moments
with you.</i>

576
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:46,840
<i>I know you're supposed to,
like, play it cool.</i>

577
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,105
<i>You're supposed to be like,</i>

578
00:39:48,105 --> 00:39:49,073
<i>"Oh, I like you guys
a little bit."</i>

579
00:39:49,073 --> 00:39:50,778
<i>But genuinely,</i>

580
00:39:50,778 --> 00:39:52,846
<i>this has meant more to me
than anything I've ever done</i>

581
00:39:52,846 --> 00:39:56,278
<i>or been a part of in my life.
This tour. So...</i>

582
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,354
<i>Ah.</i>

583
00:40:06,354 --> 00:40:08,697
<i>And, you know,
before this tour,</i>

584
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,457
<i>I would... I would go
through this process</i>

585
00:40:10,457 --> 00:40:12,030
<i>where I'd make an album,</i>

586
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,131
<i>and I'd call the album
something like</i>

587
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:17,508
Red <i>or</i> Speak Now <i>or</i> Fearless
<i>or, you know.</i>

588
00:40:17,508 --> 00:40:19,004
<i>And then I'd go,</i>

589
00:40:19,004 --> 00:40:21,644
<i>I'd put together a tour called
the name of that album, right?</i>

590
00:40:21,644 --> 00:40:24,438
<i>Like the</i> 1989 <i>tour,</i>
Speak Now <i>tour.</i>

591
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:26,209
<i>And we'd do it like that.</i>

592
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:28,310
<i>And I remember like,</i>

593
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:31,885
<i>why am I just do...
What is this...?</i>

594
00:40:31,885 --> 00:40:34,789
<i>- Why?</i>

595
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:37,990
<i>Anyway, um,
so with this tour,</i>

596
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,992
<i>I remember people
would come up to me</i>

597
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:42,060
<i>and they'd be like,
"So you've put out,
like, five albums</i>

598
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,798
<i>"that you haven't
done tours for.</i>

599
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:45,360
<i>"So what's your plan? Like,
what are you going to do?</i>

600
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,703
<i>"You're going to just,
like, do a show</i>

601
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:49,969
<i>"with, like,
all the albums in it</i>

602
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:51,399
<i>"and it'll be like, what?</i>

603
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:53,401
<i>"Like, a three-and-a-half
hour long show?"</i>

604
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,720
<i>And I was like,
"Yeah, it's...</i>

605
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,558
<i>"it's going to be called
The Eras Tour.
See you there."</i>

606
00:41:12,895 --> 00:41:19,031
<i>So we are currently
in the</i> evermore <i>Era and, um...</i>

607
00:41:22,641 --> 00:41:25,235
<i>and that was my second
pandemic album that I made.</i>

608
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:30,680
<i>And I remember there was...
There was one specific song</i>

609
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,848
<i>where after I wrote it
I thought, you know,</i>

610
00:41:33,848 --> 00:41:36,752
<i>that would be
a really cathartic experience,</i>

611
00:41:36,752 --> 00:41:40,019
<i>I'm sure, to get
to sing</i> Champagne Problems

612
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:42,153
<i>- in a stadium, you know?</i>

613
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,762
<i>So let's do it.</i>

614
00:42:08,115 --> 00:42:12,216
<i>You booked the night train
for a reason</i>

615
00:42:12,216 --> 00:42:16,451
<i>So you could sit there
in this hurt</i>

616
00:42:19,192 --> 00:42:23,425
<i>Bustling crowds
or silent sleepers</i>

617
00:42:23,425 --> 00:42:28,265
<i>You're not sure
which is worse</i>

618
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:32,467
<i>Because I dropped your hand
while dancing</i>

619
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:37,274
<i>Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing</i>

620
00:42:37,274 --> 00:42:39,980
<i>Champagne problems</i>

621
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,950
<i>Your mom's ring
in your pocket</i>

622
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,689
<i>My picture in your wallet</i>

623
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:48,186
<i>Your heart was glass
I dropped it</i>

624

<i>Champagne problems</i>

625
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,676
<i>You told your family
for a reason</i>

626
00:43:07,141 --> 00:43:10,648
<i>You couldn't keep it in</i>

627
00:43:13,213 --> 00:43:16,753
<i>Your sister splashed out
on the bottle</i>

628
00:43:17,646 --> 00:43:22,517
<i>Now no one's celebrating</i>

629
00:43:23,388 --> 00:43:26,455
<i>Dom Pérignon, you brought it</i>

630
00:43:26,455 --> 00:43:28,963
<i>No crowd of friends applauded</i>

631
00:43:28,963 --> 00:43:31,328
<i>Your hometown skeptics
called it</i>

632
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:34,529
<i>Champagne problems</i>

633
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,301
<i>You had a speech
You're speechless</i>

634
00:43:37,301 --> 00:43:39,743
<i>Love slipped
beyond your reaches</i>

635
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:42,240
<i>And I couldn't
give a reason</i>

636

<i>Champagne problems</i>

637
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,773
<i>Your Midas touch
on the Chevy door</i>

00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:12,501
<i>November flush
and your flannel cure</i>

<i>"This dorm was
once a madhouse"</i>

640
00:44:14,701 --> 00:44:17,242
<i>I made a joke
"Well, it's made for me"</i>

641
00:44:17,242 --> 00:44:20,575
<i>How evergreen
Our group of friends</i>

642
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,248
<i>Don't think
we'll say that word again</i>

643
00:44:23,248 --> 00:44:26,757
<i>And soon they'll have
the nerve to deck the halls</i>

644
00:44:26,757 --> 00:44:28,253
<i>That we once walked through</i>

645
00:44:28,253 --> 00:44:30,893
<i>One for the money
Two for the show</i>

646
00:44:30,893 --> 00:44:33,390
<i>I never was ready
so I watch you go</i>

647
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,964
<i>Sometimes you just
don't know the answer</i>

648
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,934
<i>Till someone's
on their knees and asks you</i>

649
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:41,629
<i>"She would've made
such a lovely bride</i>

650
00:44:41,629 --> 00:44:44,302
<i>"What a shame she's fucked
in the head," they said</i>

651
00:44:44,302 --> 00:44:46,810
<i>But you'll find
the real thing instead</i>

652
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,978
<i>She'll patch up
your tapestry that I shred</i>

653
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:53,245
<i>And hold your hand
while dancing</i>

654
00:44:53,245 --> 00:44:58,382
<i>Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing</i>

655
00:44:58,382 --> 00:45:01,055
<i>With champagne problems</i>

656

<i>Your mom's ring

<i>You won't remember all my
Champagne problems</i>

660
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,526
<i>That's a very generous thing
to do for somebody.</i>

661
00:46:49,526 --> 00:46:51,902
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

662
00:46:51,902 --> 00:46:52,969
<i>Ah.</i>

663
00:48:33,962 --> 00:48:40,142
<i>I sit and watch you
reading with your head low</i>

664
00:48:41,904 --> 00:48:43,937
<i>I wake and watch you</i>

665
00:48:43,937 --> 00:48:48,513
<i>Breathing with your eyes closed</i>

666
00:48:49,879 --> 00:48:53,155
<i>I sit and watch you</i>

667
00:48:53,155 --> 00:48:59,029
<i>I notice everything
you do or don't do</i>

668
00:48:59,029 --> 00:49:03,990
<i>You're so much older
and wiser and I</i>

669
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:08,863
<i>I wait by the door
like I'm just a kid</i>

670
00:49:10,174 --> 00:49:13,406
<i>Use my best colors
for your portrait</i>

671
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:18,048
<i>Lay the table
with the fancy shit</i>

672
00:49:18,941 --> 00:49:22,745
<i>And watch you tolerate it</i>

673
00:49:22,745 --> 00:49:25,418
<i>If it's all in my head
Tell me now</i>

674
00:49:26,784 --> 00:49:30,588
<i>Tell me
I've got it wrong somehow</i>

675
00:49:30,588 --> 00:49:35,021
<i>I know my love
should be celebrated</i>

676

<i>But you tolerate it</i>

677
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:42,028
<i>While you were out building
other worlds, where was I?</i>

678
00:49:42,028 --> 00:49:43,436
<i>Where's that man</i>

679
00:49:43,436 --> 00:49:46,373
<i>Who'd throw blankets
over my barbed wire?</i>

680
00:49:46,373 --> 00:49:50,773
<i>I made you my temple
My mural, my sky</i>

681
00:49:50,773 --> 00:49:52,775
<i>Now I'm begging
for footnotes</i>

682
00:49:52,775 --> 00:49:54,876
<i>In the story of your life</i>

683
00:49:54,876 --> 00:49:57,945
<i>Drawing hearts
in the byline</i>

684
00:49:57,945 --> 00:50:02,257
<i>Always taking up
too much space or time</i>

685
00:50:02,257 --> 00:50:07,394
<i>You assume I'm fine
But what would you do if I</i>

686
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,137
<i>Break free
and leave us in ruins</i>

687
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:17,437
<i>Took this dagger in me
and removed it</i>

688
00:50:19,067 --> 00:50:23,146
<i>Gain the weight of you
Then lose it</i>

689
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:27,040
<i>Believe me, I could do it</i>

690
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,746
<i>If it's all in my head
Tell me now</i>

691
00:50:30,848 --> 00:50:34,817
<i>Tell me
I've got it wrong somehow</i>

692

<i>I know my love
should be celebrated</i>

<i>But you tolerate it</i>

694
00:50:55,774 --> 00:50:59,743
<i>I sit and watch you</i>

695
00:51:46,693 --> 00:51:49,694
<i>Knew he was a killer
first time that I saw him</i>

696
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:50,893
<i>Wondered how many girls</i>

697
00:51:50,893 --> 00:51:52,796
<i>He had loved
and left haunted</i>

698
00:51:52,796 --> 00:51:55,832
<i>But if he's a ghost
Then I can be a phantom</i>

699
00:51:55,832 --> 00:51:58,307
<i>Holdin' him
for ransom, some</i>

700
00:51:58,307 --> 00:52:00,067
<i>Some boys
are tryin' too hard</i>

701
00:52:00,067 --> 00:52:01,475
<i>He don't try at all though</i>

702
00:52:01,475 --> 00:52:02,674
<i>Younger than my exes</i>

703
00:52:02,674 --> 00:52:04,676
<i>But he act
like such a man, so</i>

704
00:52:04,676 --> 00:52:06,007
<i>I see nothing better</i>

705
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:10,143
<i>I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta</i>

706
00:52:10,143 --> 00:52:13,718
<i>I, I, I see
how this is gon' go</i>

707
00:52:13,718 --> 00:52:16,226

<i>Are you ready for it?</i>

716
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:55,529
<i>Knew I was a robber

<i>But if I'm a thief</i>

join the heist, and</i>

<i>We'll move
to an island, and</i>

<i>And he can be my jailer
Burton to this Taylor</i>

01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,588
<i>I got harder
in the nick of time</i>

913
01:03:26,588 --> 01:03:28,590
<i>Honey, I rose up
from the dead</i>

914
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:30,229
<i>I do it all the time</i>

915
01:03:30,229 --> 01:03:32,099
<i>I've got a list of names</i>

916
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:34,662
<i>And yours is in red Underlined</i>

917
01:03:34,662 --> 01:03:37,863
<i>I check it once
Then I check it twice, oh!</i>

918
01:03:37,863 --> 01:03:40,338
<i>Ooh, look what
you made me do</i>

919
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:41,867
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

920
01:03:41,867 --> 01:03:43,770
<i>Look what you just made me do</i>

921
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,442
<i>Look what you just made me</i>

922
01:03:45,442 --> 01:03:47,873
<i>Ooh, look what you made me do</i>

923
01:03:47,873 --> 01:03:49,710
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

924
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:52,779
<i>Look what
you just made me do</i>

925
01:03:52,779 --> 01:03:57,190
<i>I don't like
your kingdom keys</i>

926
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:01,293
<i>They once belonged to me</i>

927
01:04:01,293 --> 01:04:04,593
<i>You asked me
for a place to sleep</i>

928
01:04:04,593 --> 01:04:07,299
<i>Locked me out
and threw a feast</i>

929
01:04:07,299 --> 01:04:09,037
<i>- What?
- The world moves on</i>

930
01:04:09,037 --> 01:04:11,732
<i>Another day
Another drama, drama</i>

931
01:04:11,732 --> 01:04:15,538
<i>But not for me, not for me
All I think about is karma</i>

932
01:04:15,538 --> 01:04:16,946
<i>And then the world moves on</i>

933
01:04:16,946 --> 01:04:19,278
<i>But one thing's for sure</i>

934
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:23,051
<i>Maybe I got mine
But you'll all get yours</i>

935
01:04:23,051 --> 01:04:24,283
<i>But I got smarter</i>

936
01:04:24,283 --> 01:04:26,648
<i>I got harder
in the nick of time</i>

937

942
01:04:37,967 --> 01:04:40,233
<i>Ooh, look what you made me do</i>

943
01:04:40,233 --> 01:04:42,268
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

944

<i>Look what you just made me do</i>

949
01:04:52,905 --> 01:04:56,843
<i>I don't trust nobody

950

978
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:57,535
<i>There I was again tonight</i>

979
01:06:57,535 --> 01:07:00,373
<i>Forcing laughter
Faking smiles</i>

980
01:07:00,373 --> 01:07:03,904
<i>Same old tired, lonely place</i>

981
01:07:06,315 --> 01:07:09,041
<i>Walls of insincerity</i>

982
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:11,978
<i>Shifting eyes and vacancy</i>

983
01:07:11,978 --> 01:07:15,421
<i>Vanished when I saw your face</i>

984
01:07:15,421 --> 01:07:18,985
<i>All I can say is it was</i>

985
01:07:18,985 --> 01:07:25,860
<i>Enchanting to meet you</i>

986
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:32,504
<i>Your eyes whispered
"Have we met?"</i>

987
01:07:32,504 --> 01:07:35,342
<i>Across the room
Your silhouette</i>

988
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:39,038
<i>Starts to make its way to me</i>

989
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:44,010
<i>The playful
conversation starts</i>

990
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,980
<i>Counter all
your quick remarks</i>

991
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:51,292
<i>Like passing notes
in secrecy</i>

992
01:07:51,987 --> 01:07:54,119
<i>And it was</i>

993
01:07:54,119 --> 01:08:00,697
<i>Enchanting to meet you</i>

994
01:08:02,206 --> 01:08:05,867
<i>All I can say is I was</i>

995
01:08:05,867 --> 01:08:12,907
<i>Enchanted to meet you</i>

996
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:23,049
<i>This night is sparklin'
Don't you let it go</i>

997
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:28,857
<i>I'm wonderstruck
Blushin' all the way home</i>

998
01:08:28,857 --> 01:08:34,632
<i>I'll spend forever
wonderin' if you knew</i>

999
01:08:34,632 --> 01:08:41,672
<i>I was enchanted to meet you</i>

1000
01:09:00,561 --> 01:09:03,826
<i>This is me praying that</i>

1001
01:09:03,826 --> 01:09:06,334
<i>This was the very first page</i>

1002
01:09:06,334 --> 01:09:09,865
<i>Not where the storyline ends</i>

1003
01:09:09,865 --> 01:09:12,274
<i>My thoughts
will echo your name</i>

1004
01:09:12,274 --> 01:09:15,244
<i>Until I see you again</i>

1005
01:09:15,244 --> 01:09:18,247
<i>These are the words
I held back</i>

1006
01:09:18,247 --> 01:09:21,283
<i>As I was leaving too soon</i>

1007
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:26,849
<i>I was enchanted
to meet you</i>

1008
01:09:26,849 --> 01:09:32,756
<i>Please, don't be in love
with someone else</i>

1009
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:38,432
<i>Please, don't have
somebody waiting on you</i>

1010
01:09:38,432 --> 01:09:44,306
<i>Please, don't be in love
with someone else</i>

1011
01:09:44,306 --> 01:09:51,038
<i>Please, don't have
somebody waiting on you</i>

1012
01:09:51,038 --> 01:09:56,714
<i>This night is sparklin'
Don't you let it go</i>

<i>I'm wonderstruck
Blushin' all the way home</i>

1014
01:10:02,819 --> 01:10:06,251
<i>I'll spend forever</i>

1015
01:10:06,251 --> 01:10:11,498
<i>Wonderin' if you knew</i>

1016
01:10:14,371 --> 01:10:20,265
<i>This night is flawless
Don't you let it go</i>

1017
01:10:20,265 --> 01:10:26,139
<i>I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone</i>

1018
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:31,683
<i>I'll spend forever
wonderin' if you knew</i>

1019
01:10:31,683 --> 01:10:37,249
<i>I was enchanted to meet you</i>

1020
01:10:37,249 --> 01:10:39,757
<i>Please, don't be in love</i>

1021
01:10:39,757 --> 01:10:42,958
<i>With someone else</i>

1022
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:48,997
<i>Please, don't have
somebody waiting on you</i>

1023
01:11:11,857 --> 01:11:14,363
<i>It feels like
a perfect night</i>

1024
01:11:14,363 --> 01:11:16,398
<i>To dress up like hipsters</i>

1025
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:18,961
<i>And make fun of our exes</i>

1026
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:21,194
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

1027
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:23,702
<i>It feels like
a perfect night</i>

1028
01:11:23,702 --> 01:11:25,704
<i>For breakfast at midnight</i>

1029
01:11:25,704 --> 01:11:28,575
<i>To fall in love with strangers</i>

1030
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:30,478
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

1031
01:11:30,478 --> 01:11:32,513
<i>Yeah</i>

1032
01:11:32,513 --> 01:11:34,548
<i>We're happy, free
Confused and lonely</i>

1033
01:11:34,548 --> 01:11:36,715
<i>At the same time</i>

1034
01:11:36,715 --> 01:11:39,047
<i>It's miserable and magical</i>

1035
01:11:39,047 --> 01:11:41,313
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1036
01:11:41,313 --> 01:11:42,754
<i>Tonight's the night</i>

1037
01:11:42,754 --> 01:11:45,526
<i>When we forget
about the deadlines</i>

1038
01:11:45,526 --> 01:11:48,089
<i>It's time</i>

1039
01:11:48,089 --> 01:11:49,497
<i>Ah, ah</i>

1040
01:11:49,497 --> 01:11:51,026
<i>I don't know about you</i>

1041
01:11:51,026 --> 01:11:53,897
<i>But I'm feeling 22</i>

1042
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:56,163
<i>Everything will be all right if</i>

1043
01:11:56,163 --> 01:11:59,067
<i>You keep me next to you</i>

1044
01:11:59,067 --> 01:12:00,541
<i>You don't know about me</i>

1045
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:03,104
<i>But I'll bet you want to</i>

1046
01:12:03,104 --> 01:12:05,414
<i>Everything will be all right if</i>

1047
01:12:05,414 --> 01:12:08,417
<i>We just keep dancing
like we're</i>

1048
01:12:08,417 --> 01:12:11,783
<i>22</i>

1049
01:12:12,984 --> 01:12:16,425
<i>22</i>

1050
01:12:16,425 --> 01:12:18,856
<i>It feels like
one of those nights</i>

1051
01:12:18,856 --> 01:12:21,122
<i>This place is too crowded</i>

1052
01:12:21,122 --> 01:12:23,289
<i>Too many cool kids</i>

1053
01:12:23,289 --> 01:12:25,467
<i>"Who is Taylor Swift
anyway? Ew"</i>

1054
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:28,569
<i>It seems like
one of those nights</i>

1055
01:12:28,569 --> 01:12:30,604
<i>We ditch the whole scene</i>

1056
01:12:30,604 --> 01:12:34,872
<i>And end up dreaming
instead of sleeping</i>

1057
01:12:34,872 --> 01:12:36,808
<i>Yeah</i>

1058
01:12:36,808 --> 01:12:39,371
<i>We're happy, free
Confused and lonely</i>

1059
01:12:39,371 --> 01:12:41,813
<i>In the best way</i>

1060
01:12:41,813 --> 01:12:43,782
<i>It's miserable and magical</i>

1061
01:12:43,782 --> 01:12:46,081
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1062
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:47,379
<i>Tonight's the night</i>

1063
01:12:47,379 --> 01:12:50,250
<i>When we forget
about the heartbreaks</i>

1064
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,318
<i>It's time</i>

1065
01:12:52,318 --> 01:12:53,792
<i>Ah, ah</i>

1066
01:12:53,792 --> 01:12:55,596
<i>Hey!

01:21:49,494 --> 01:21:52,495
<i>I walked through
the door with you</i>

1221
01:21:52,495 --> 01:21:54,761
<i>The air was cold</i>

1222
01:21:54,761 --> 01:21:59,007
<i>But something 'bout it
felt like home somehow</i>

1223
01:21:59,007 --> 01:22:04,276
<i>And I left my scarf there
at your sister's house</i>

1224
01:22:04,276 --> 01:22:10,678
<i>And you've still got it
in your drawer, even now</i>

1225
01:22:20,162 --> 01:22:25,561
<i>Oh, your sweet disposition
and my wide-eyed gaze</i>

1226
01:22:25,561 --> 01:22:31,138
<i>We're singing in the car
Getting lost upstate</i>

1227
01:22:31,138 --> 01:22:35,307
<i>Autumn leaves falling down
like pieces into place</i>

1228
01:22:35,307 --> 01:22:41,082
<i>And I can picture it
after all these days</i>

1229
01:22:41,082 --> 01:22:43,645
<i>And I know
it's long gone and</i>

1230
01:22:43,645 --> 01:22:46,252
<i>That magic's not here
no more</i>

1231
01:22:46,252 --> 01:22:48,056
<i>And I might be okay</i>

1232
01:22:48,056 --> 01:22:51,587
<i>But I'm not fine at all</i>

1233
01:22:51,587 --> 01:22:56,592
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1234
01:22:56,592 --> 01:23:01,762
<i>'Cause there we are again
on that little town street</i>

1235
01:23:01,762 --> 01:23:03,698
<i>You almost ran the red</i>

1236
01:23:03,698 --> 01:23:06,206
<i>'Cause you were
lookin' over at me</i>

1237
01:23:06,206 --> 01:23:08,835
<i>Wind in my hair, I was there</i>

1238
01:23:08,835 --> 01:23:14,775
<i>I remember it
all too well</i>

1239
01:23:17,153 --> 01:23:22,189
<i>Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red</i>

1240
01:23:22,189 --> 01:23:23,685
<i>You used to be a little kid</i>

1241
01:23:23,685 --> 01:23:27,623
<i>With glasses
in a twin-sized bed</i>

1242
01:23:27,623 --> 01:23:30,560
<i>Your mother's telling
stories 'bout you</i>

1243
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,057
<i>On the tee-ball team</i>

1244
01:23:33,057 --> 01:23:34,894
<i>You taught me 'bout your past</i>

1245
01:23:34,894 --> 01:23:37,567
<i>Thinking your future
was me</i>

1246
01:23:37,567 --> 01:23:40,141
<i>And you were tossing me
the car keys</i>

1247
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:41,802
<i>"Fuck the patriarchy"</i>

1248
01:23:41,802 --> 01:23:44,574
<i>Keychain on the ground</i>

1249
01:23:44,574 --> 01:23:47,742
<i>We were always
skipping town</i>

1250
01:23:47,742 --> 01:23:50,712
<i>And I was thinking
on the drive down</i>

1251
01:23:50,712 --> 01:23:54,617
<i>Any time now
He's gonna say it's love</i>

1252
01:23:54,617 --> 01:23:57,950
<i>You never called it
what it was</i>

1253
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,986
<i>Till we were dead and gone
and buried</i>

1254
01:24:00,986 --> 01:24:02,823
<i>Check the pulse and come back</i>

1255
01:24:02,823 --> 01:24:05,232
<i>Swearing it's the same</i>

1256
01:24:05,232 --> 01:24:08,466
<i>After three months
in the grave</i>

1257
01:24:08,466 --> 01:24:11,304
<i>And then you wondered
where it went to</i>

1258
01:24:11,304 --> 01:24:12,932
<i>As I reached for you</i>

1259
01:24:12,932 --> 01:24:15,506
<i>But all I felt was shame</i>

1260
01:24:15,506 --> 01:24:18,740
<i>And you held
my lifeless frame</i>

1261
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:21,908
<i>And I know
it's long gone and</i>

1262
01:24:21,908 --> 01:24:24,482
<i>There was nothing else
I could do</i>

1263
01:24:24,482 --> 01:24:27,155
<i>And I forget about you
long enough</i>

1264
01:24:27,155 --> 01:24:35,196
<i>To forget why I needed to</i>

1265
01:24:35,196 --> 01:24:40,300
<i>'Cause there we are again
in the middle of the night</i>

1266
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,027
<i>We're dancing
'round the kitchen</i>

1267
01:24:42,027 --> 01:24:44,502
<i>In the refrigerator light</i>

1268
01:24:44,502 --> 01:24:47,175
<i>Down the stairs, I was there</i>

1269
01:24:47,175 --> 01:24:53,676
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1270
01:24:55,581 --> 01:25:00,980
<i>And there we are again
when nobody had to know</i>

1271
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:05,193
<i>You kept me like a secret
but I kept you like an oath</i>

1272
01:25:05,193 --> 01:25:07,822
<i>Sacred prayer and we'd swear</i>

1273
01:25:07,822 --> 01:25:09,824
<i>To remember it</i>

1274
01:25:09,824 --> 01:25:16,633
<i>All too well, yeah</i>

1275
01:25:31,012 --> 01:25:34,145
<i>Well, maybe we got
lost in translation</i>

1276
01:25:34,145 --> 01:25:36,389
<i>Maybe I asked for too much</i>

1277
01:25:36,389 --> 01:25:39,491
<i>But maybe this thing
was a masterpiece</i>

1278
01:25:39,491 --> 01:25:41,394
<i>Till you tore it all up</i>

1279
01:25:41,394 --> 01:25:44,364
<i>Running scared, I was there</i>

1280
01:25:44,364 --> 01:25:51,866
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1281
01:25:51,866 --> 01:25:54,506
<i>And you call me up again</i>

1282
01:25:54,506 --> 01:25:57,575
<i>Just to break me
like a promise</i>

1283
01:25:57,575 --> 01:26:02,206
<i>So casually cruel in
the name of "being honest"</i>

1284
01:26:02,206 --> 01:26:06,177
<i>I'm a crumpled up
piece of paper lying here</i>

1285
01:26:06,177 --> 01:26:12,788
<i>'Cause I remember it
all, all, all</i>

1286
01:26:12,788 --> 01:26:15,758
<i>They say all's well
that ends well</i>

1287
01:26:15,758 --> 01:26:18,024
<i>But I'm in a new hell</i>

1288
01:26:18,024 --> 01:26:22,963
<i>Every time
you double-cross my mind</i>

1289
01:26:22,963 --> 01:26:26,802
<i>You said if we had
been closer in age</i>

1290
01:26:26,802 --> 01:26:30,410
<i>Maybe it would have been fine</i>

1291
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:33,710
<i>And that made me want to die</i>

1292
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:36,713
<i>The idea you had of me
Who was she?</i>

1293
01:26:36,713 --> 01:26:40,244
<i>A never-needy
ever-lovely jewel</i>

1294
01:26:40,244 --> 01:26:43,951
<i>Whose shine reflects on you</i>

1295
01:26:43,951 --> 01:26:46,657
<i>Not weeping
in a party bathroom</i>

1296
01:26:46,657 --> 01:26:50,793
<i>Some actress asking me
what happened, you</i>

1297
01:26:50,793 --> 01:26:54,434
<i>That's what happened, you</i>

1298
01:26:54,434 --> 01:26:59,637
<i>You who charmed my dad
with self-effacing jokes</i>

1299
01:26:59,637 --> 01:27:04,235
<i>Sipping coffee like
you're on a late-night show</i>

1300
01:27:04,235 --> 01:27:07,645
<i>But then he watched me watch
the front door all night</i>

1301
01:27:07,645 --> 01:27:09,482
<i>Willing you to come</i>

1302
01:27:09,482 --> 01:27:12,650
<i>And he said
"It's supposed to be fun</i>

1303
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:15,884
<i>"Turning 21"</i>

1304
01:27:28,294 --> 01:27:29,832
<i>Time won't fly</i>

1305
01:27:29,832 --> 01:27:33,099
<i>It's like
I'm paralyzed by it</i>

1306
01:27:33,099 --> 01:27:35,442
<i>I'd like to be
my old self again</i>

1307
01:27:35,442 --> 01:27:37,708
<i>But I'm still
trying to find it</i>

1308
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:40,205
<i>After plaid shirt days</i>

1309
01:27:40,205 --> 01:27:43,208
<i>And nights when
you made me your own</i>

1310
01:27:43,208 --> 01:27:48,356
<i>Now you mail back my things
and I walk home alone</i>

1311
01:27:48,356 --> 01:27:53,559
<i>But you keep my old scarf
from that very first week</i>

1312
01:27:53,559 --> 01:27:56,364
<i>'Cause it reminds you
of innocence</i>

1313
01:27:56,364 --> 01:27:58,531
<i>And it smells like me</i>

1314
01:27:58,531 --> 01:28:00,225
<i>You can't get rid of it</i>

1315
01:28:00,898 --> 01:28:02,898
<i>'Cause you remember it</i>

1316
01:28:02,898 --> 01:28:09,201
<i>All too well, yeah</i>

1317
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:14,415
<i>'Cause there we are again
when I loved you so</i>

1318
01:28:14,415 --> 01:28:16,340
<i>Back before you lost</i>

1319
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:19,013
<i>The one real thing
you've ever known</i>

1320
01:28:19,013 --> 01:28:21,488
<i>It was rare, I was there</i>

1321
01:28:21,488 --> 01:28:27,857
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1322
01:28:29,223 --> 01:28:31,762
<i>Wind in my hair
You were there</i>

1323
01:28:31,762 --> 01:28:34,402
<i>You remember it all</i>

1324
01:28:34,402 --> 01:28:37,097
<i>Down the stairs
You were there</i>

1325
01:28:37,097 --> 01:28:39,869
<i>You remember it all</i>

1326
01:28:39,869 --> 01:28:42,267
<i>It was rare, I was there</i>

1327
01:28:42,267 --> 01:28:48,911
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1328
01:28:48,911 --> 01:28:52,783
<i>And I was never good
at telling jokes</i>

1329
01:28:52,783 --> 01:28:54,917
<i>But the punch line goes</i>

1330
01:28:54,917 --> 01:29:00,560
<i>"I'll get older
But your lovers stay my age"</i>

1331
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:05,356
<i>From when your Brooklyn
broke my skin and bones</i>

1332
01:29:05,356 --> 01:29:10,735
<i>I'm a soldier who's
returning half her weight</i>

1333
01:29:10,735 --> 01:29:16,136
<i>And did the twin flame
bruise paint you blue?</i>

1334
01:29:16,136 --> 01:29:17,577
<i>Just between us</i>

1335
01:29:17,577 --> 01:29:21,075
<i>Did the love affair
maim you, too?</i>

1336
01:29:21,075 --> 01:29:24,947
<i>'Cause in this city's
barren cold</i>

1337
01:29:24,947 --> 01:29:30,084
<i>I still remember
the first fall of snow</i>

1338
01:29:30,084 --> 01:29:34,495
<i>And how it glistened
as it fell</i>

1339
01:29:34,495 --> 01:29:38,532
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1340
01:29:41,933 --> 01:29:43,328
<i>Just between us</i>

1341
01:29:43,328 --> 01:29:46,298
<i>Did the love affair
maim you</i>

1342
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:52,271
<i>All too well?</i>

1343
01:29:52,271 --> 01:29:56,484
<i>Just between us
Do you remember it</i>

1344
01:29:56,484 --> 01:30:01,214
<i>All too well?</i>

1345
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,283
<i>Just between us</i>

1346
01:30:04,283 --> 01:30:06,956
<i>- I remember it</i>
<i>Just between us</i>

1347
01:30:06,956 --> 01:30:10,190
<i>- All too well</i>
<i>Wind in my hair</i>

1348
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:14,095
<i>- I was there, I was there
- I was there</i>

1349

<i>Down the stairs
I was there, I was there</i>

1350
01:30:17,769 --> 01:30:19,540
<i>I was there</i>

1351
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:23,038
<i>Sacred prayer
I was there, I was there</i>

1352
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:27,471
<i>It was rare
You remember it</i>

<i>It was rare
You remember it</i>

1364
01:31:47,124 --> 01:31:50,290
<i>I'm doing good
I'm on some new shit</i>

01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:53,898
<i>Been saying "yes"
instead of "no"</i>

1366
01:31:53,898 --> 01:31:56,065
<i>I thought I saw you
at the bus stop</i>

1367
01:31:56,065 --> 01:31:57,495
<i>I didn't though</i>

1368
01:32:00,775 --> 01:32:03,402
<i>I hit the ground running
each night</i>

1369
01:32:04,273 --> 01:32:07,472
<i>I hit the Sunday matinee</i>

1370
01:32:07,472 --> 01:32:11,410
<i>You know the greatest films
of all time were never made</i>

1371
01:32:14,448 --> 01:32:17,757
<i>I guess you never know
Never know</i>

1372
01:32:17,757 --> 01:32:21,387
<i>And if you wanted me
You really should've showed</i>

1373
01:32:21,387 --> 01:32:24,390
<i>And if you never bleed
You're never gonna grow</i>

1374
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:27,096
<i>And it's all right now</i>

1375
01:32:28,363 --> 01:32:31,837
<i>But we were something
Don't you think so?</i>

1376
01:32:31,837 --> 01:32:35,104
<i>Roaring twenties
Tossing pennies in the pool</i>

1377
01:32:35,104 --> 01:32:38,041
<i>And if my wishes came true</i>

1378
01:32:38,714 --> 01:32:41,209
<i>It would've been you</i>

1379
01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:45,686
<i>In my defense, I have none</i>

1380
01:32:45,686 --> 01:32:48,986
<i>For never leaving
well enough alone</i>

1381
01:32:48,986 --> 01:32:55,355
<i>But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one</i>

1382
01:32:57,161 --> 01:33:00,701
<i>Ooh</i>

1383
01:33:02,529 --> 01:33:05,706
<i>I have this dream
you're doing cool shit</i>

1384
01:33:05,706 --> 01:33:09,006
<i>Having adventures on your own</i>

1385
01:33:09,006 --> 01:33:11,536
<i>You meet some woman
on the Internet</i>

1386
01:33:11,536 --> 01:33:13,043
<i>And take her home</i>

1387
01:33:16,343 --> 01:33:19,720
<i>We never painted
by the numbers, baby</i>

1388
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:23,020
<i>But we were making it count</i>

1389
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,892
<i>You know the greatest loves
of all time are over now</i>

1390
01:33:30,062 --> 01:33:33,492
<i>I guess you never know
Never know</i>

1391
01:33:33,492 --> 01:33:37,133
<i>And it's another day
Waking up alone</i>

1392
01:33:37,133 --> 01:33:40,532
<i>But we were something
Don't you think so?</i>

1393
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:43,810
<i>Roaring twenties
Tossing pennies in the pool</i>

1394
01:33:43,810 --> 01:33:46,714
<i>And if my wishes came true</i>

1395
01:33:47,409 --> 01:33:50,014
<i>It would've been you</i>

1396
01:33:50,852 --> 01:33:54,216
<i>In my defense, I have none</i>

1397
01:33:54,216 --> 01:33:57,582
<i>For never leaving
well enough alone</i>

1398
01:33:57,582 --> 01:34:00,222
<i>But it would've been fun</i>

1399
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:04,028
<i>If you would've been the one</i>

1400
01:34:04,028 --> 01:34:06,162
<i>Hey, yeah-yeah</i>

1401
01:34:06,162 --> 01:34:09,770
<i>I persist and resist
the temptation to ask you</i>

1402
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:13,169
<i>If one thing
had been different</i>

1403
01:34:13,169 --> 01:34:18,240
<i>Would everything
be different today?</i>

1404
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:21,540
<i>We were something
Don't you think so?</i>

1405
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:25,016
<i>Rosé flowing
with your chosen family</i>

1406
01:34:25,016 --> 01:34:27,645
<i>And it would've been sweet</i>

1407
01:34:28,384 --> 01:34:30,890
<i>If it could've been me</i>

1408
01:34:31,827 --> 01:34:34,289
<i>In my defense, I have none</i>

1409
01:34:35,391 --> 01:34:38,623
<i>For digging up
the grave another time</i>

1410
01:34:38,623 --> 01:34:42,066
<i>But it would've been fun</i>

1411
01:34:42,066 --> 01:34:44,563
<i>If you would've been
the one</i>

1412
01:34:46,809 --> 01:34:50,437
<i>Ooh</i>

1413
01:35:08,831 --> 01:35:12,932
<i>And so, we have brought
the</i> folklore <i>cabin to L.A.</i>

1414
01:35:18,663 --> 01:35:22,436
<i>So, um,</i> folklore <i>is an album
that I am extremely proud of,</i>

1415
01:35:22,436 --> 01:35:24,702
<i>- and I started, uh...</i>

1416
01:35:25,507 --> 01:35:26,847
<i>Aw...</i>

1417
01:35:26,847 --> 01:35:30,147
<i>- Aw... thanks.</i>

1418
01:35:31,412 --> 01:35:33,414
<i>I immediately
was picturing</i>

1419
01:35:33,414 --> 01:35:36,923
<i>this album taking place
in the woods,</i>

1420
01:35:36,923 --> 01:35:39,255
<i>in an imaginary cabin.</i>

1421
01:35:39,255 --> 01:35:41,686
<i>In my fantasy,
in my imagination,</i>

1422
01:35:41,686 --> 01:35:43,655
<i>I am not</i>

1423
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:46,966
<i>a lonely millennial woman
covered in cat hair,</i>

1424
01:35:46,966 --> 01:35:48,264
<i>- um...</i>

1425
01:35:48,264 --> 01:35:50,596
<i>...watching 700 hours
of TV a day.</i>

1426
01:35:50,596 --> 01:35:54,765
<i>In my imagination,
I am like a...</i>

1427
01:35:54,765 --> 01:35:56,877
<i>like a woodsy Victorian lady</i>

1428
01:35:56,877 --> 01:35:59,770
<i>who is wandering
through the forest,</i>

1429
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:03,851
<i>holding, like,
a candlestick holder-thing</i>

1430
01:36:03,851 --> 01:36:06,854
<i>and, like, you know,
collecting feathers</i>

1431
01:36:06,854 --> 01:36:10,352
<i>to make my own quill
to write on parchment paper.</i>

1432
01:36:10,352 --> 01:36:12,057
<i>It was a whole thing.</i>

1433
01:36:12,057 --> 01:36:14,125
<i>That was how I pictured myself
when I was writing</i> folklore.

1434
01:36:14,125 --> 01:36:15,819
<i>And then I was like,
you know, maybe</i>

1435
01:36:15,819 --> 01:36:17,491
<i>I should do some other things
different on this album.</i>

1436
01:36:17,491 --> 01:36:20,164
<i>Maybe I should try
creating characters</i>

1437
01:36:20,164 --> 01:36:22,001
<i>and having these characters</i>

1438
01:36:22,001 --> 01:36:24,663
<i>fall in love
and break up and...</i>

1439
01:36:26,874 --> 01:36:30,537
<i>One of my favorite, um,
characters that I created</i>

1440
01:36:31,837 --> 01:36:35,014
<i>is, uh, I call it
the Teenage Love Triangle.</i>

1441
01:36:38,745 --> 01:36:42,186
<i>The catalyst character is
this teenage boy named James,</i>

1442
01:36:43,882 --> 01:36:45,992
<i>and he</i>

1443
01:36:45,992 --> 01:36:49,688
<i>really screws things up
with the love of his life,</i>

1444
01:36:49,688 --> 01:36:51,899
<i>and he has
to apologize to her,</i>

1445
01:36:51,899 --> 01:36:53,131
<i>and try to make it right,</i>

1446
01:36:54,068 --> 01:36:56,662
<i>and long story short,</i>

1447
01:36:56,662 --> 01:36:59,071
<i>- her name is Betty.</i>

1448
01:37:11,316 --> 01:37:13,745
<i>Betty, I won't
make assumptions</i>

1449
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:16,220
<i>About why you switched
your homeroom</i>

1450
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:18,387
<i>But I think
it's 'cause of me</i>

1451
01:37:21,227 --> 01:37:24,932
<i>Betty, one time I was riding
on my skateboard</i>

1452
01:37:24,932 --> 01:37:26,692
<i>When I passed your house</i>

1453
01:37:26,692 --> 01:37:28,628
<i>It's like
I couldn't breathe</i>

1454
01:37:30,896 --> 01:37:33,402
<i>You heard the rumors
from Inez</i>

1455
01:37:33,402 --> 01:37:35,899
<i>You can't believe
a word she says</i>

1456
01:37:35,899 --> 01:37:38,737
<i>Most times
But this time it was true</i>

1457
01:37:40,411 --> 01:37:45,381
<i>The worst thing
that I ever did</i>

1458
01:37:45,381 --> 01:37:50,287
<i>Was what I did to you</i>

1459
01:37:52,423 --> 01:37:55,094
<i>But if I just showed up
at your party</i>

1460
01:37:55,094 --> 01:37:57,624
<i>Would you have me?
Would you want me?</i>

1461
01:37:57,624 --> 01:38:00,594
<i>Would you tell me
to go fuck myself</i>

1462
01:38:00,594 --> 01:38:02,596
<i>Or lead me to the garden?</i>

1463
01:38:02,596 --> 01:38:05,104
<i>In the garden
would you trust me</i>

1464
01:38:05,104 --> 01:38:08,734
<i>If I told you
it was just a summer thing?</i>

1465
01:38:08,734 --> 01:38:10,571
<i>I'm only 17</i>

1466
01:38:10,571 --> 01:38:15,180
<i>I don't know anything
but I know I miss you</i>

1467
01:38:23,949 --> 01:38:26,752
<i>Betty, I know
where it all went wrong</i>

1468
01:38:26,752 --> 01:38:28,853
<i>Your favorite song
was playing</i>

1469
01:38:28,853 --> 01:38:31,130
<i>From the far side
of the gym</i>

1470
01:38:33,959 --> 01:38:36,102
<i>I was nowhere to be found</i>

1471
01:38:36,102 --> 01:38:38,797
<i>I hate the crowds
You know that</i>

1472
01:38:38,797 --> 01:38:41,404
<i>Plus, I saw you dance
with him</i>

1473
01:38:43,474 --> 01:38:46,013
<i>You heard the rumors
from Inez</i>

1474
01:38:46,013 --> 01:38:48,510
<i>You can't believe
a word she says</i>

1475
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:51,051
<i>Most times
But this time it was true</i>

1476
01:38:52,912 --> 01:38:57,882
<i>The worst thing
that I ever did</i>

1477
01:38:57,882 --> 01:39:02,722
<i>Was what I did to you</i>

1478
01:39:04,858 --> 01:39:07,628
<i>But if I just showed up

1479
01:39:07,628 --> 01:39:10,169
<i>Would you have me?

1480
01:39:10,169 --> 01:39:13,073

1481
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:15,174

1482
01:39:15,174 --> 01:39:17,671

1485
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:27,879
<i>I don't know anything
but I know I miss you</i>

1486
01:39:36,527 --> 01:39:39,858
<i>I was walking home
on broken cobblestones</i>

1487
01:39:39,858 --> 01:39:42,696
<i>Just thinking of you
when she pulled up</i>

1488
01:39:42,696 --> 01:39:45,930
<i>Like a figment
of my worst intentions</i>

1489
01:39:45,930 --> 01:39:48,867
<i>She said
"James, get in, let's drive"</i>

1490
01:39:48,867 --> 01:39:51,342
<i>Those days turned into nights</i>

1491
01:39:51,342 --> 01:39:53,773
<i>Slept next to her but</i>

1492
01:39:53,773 --> 01:39:57,249
<i>I dreamt of you
all summer long</i>

1493
01:40:09,131 --> 01:40:11,428
<i>Betty, I'm here
on your doorstep</i>

1494
01:40:11,428 --> 01:40:13,958
<i>And I planned it out
for weeks now</i>

1495
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:16,169
<i>But it's finally
sinking in</i>

1496
01:40:18,998 --> 01:40:21,471
<i>Betty, right now
is the last time</i>

1497
01:40:21,471 --> 01:40:23,935
<i>I can dream
about what happens</i>

1498
01:40:23,935 --> 01:40:26,608
<i>When you see my face again</i>

1499
01:40:27,974 --> 01:40:32,977
<i>The only thing I wanna do</i>

1500
01:40:32,977 --> 01:40:37,421
<i>Is make it up to you</i>

1501
01:40:40,162 --> 01:40:43,856
<i>So, I showed up at your party</i>

1502
01:40:50,271 --> 01:40:54,438
<i>Yeah, I showed up
at your party</i>

1503
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:02,776
<i>Yeah, I showed up
at your party</i>

1504
01:41:02,776 --> 01:41:05,075
<i>Will you have me?
Will you love me?</i>

1505
01:41:05,075 --> 01:41:07,484
<i>Will you kiss me
on the porch</i>

1506
01:41:07,484 --> 01:41:10,190
<i>In front of
all your stupid friends?</i>

1507
01:41:10,190 --> 01:41:11,620
<i>If you kiss me</i>

1508
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:14,084
<i>Will it be
just like I dreamed it?</i>

1509
01:41:14,084 --> 01:41:16,460
<i>Will it patch
your broken wings?</i>

1510
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:18,198
<i>I'm only 17</i>

1511
01:41:18,198 --> 01:41:19,991
<i>I don't know anything</i>

1512
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:22,730
<i>But I know I miss you</i>

1513
01:41:24,998 --> 01:41:27,636
<i>Standing in your cardigan</i>

1514
01:41:30,003 --> 01:41:33,609
<i>Kissing in my car again</i>

1515
01:41:33,609 --> 01:41:38,383
<i>Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you</i>

1516
01:42:02,838 --> 01:42:06,213
<i>Rebekah rode up
on the afternoon train</i>

1517
01:42:06,213 --> 01:42:08,248
<i>It was sunny</i>

1518
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:10,349
<i>Her saltbox house
on the coast</i>

01:52:23,997 --> 01:52:26,866
<i>We gather stones</i>

1672
01:52:26,866 --> 01:52:29,869
<i>Never knowing
what they'll mean</i>

1673
01:52:31,466 --> 01:52:34,104
<i>Some to throw</i>

1674
01:52:34,104 --> 01:52:37,635
<i>Some to make a diamond ring</i>

1675
01:52:37,635 --> 01:52:40,209
<i>You know I didn't want to</i>

1676
01:52:40,209 --> 01:52:41,980
<i>Have to haunt you</i>

1677
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:44,477
<i>But what a ghostly scene</i>

1678
01:52:45,711 --> 01:52:47,480
<i>You wear the same jewels</i>

1679
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:49,317
<i>That I gave you</i>

1680
01:52:49,317 --> 01:52:52,089
<i>As you bury me</i>

1681
01:52:55,226 --> 01:53:01,362
<i>I didn't have it in myself
to go with grace</i>

1682
01:53:02,761 --> 01:53:04,398
<i>'Cause when I'd fight</i>

1683
01:53:04,398 --> 01:53:10,173
<i>You used to tell me
I was brave</i>

1684
01:53:10,173 --> 01:53:15,277
<i>And if I'm dead to you
Why are you at the wake?</i>

1685
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,840
<i>Cursing my name</i>

1686
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,677
<i>Wishing I stayed</i>

1687
01:53:19,677 --> 01:53:22,988
<i>Look at how
my tears ricochet</i>

1688
01:53:22,988 --> 01:53:26,255
<i>And I can go
anywhere I want</i>

1689
01:53:27,093 --> 01:53:28,818
<i>Anywhere I want</i>

1690
01:53:28,818 --> 01:53:30,754
<i>Just not home</i>

1691
01:53:30,754 --> 01:53:34,197
<i>And you can aim
for my heart, go for blood</i>

1692
01:53:34,197 --> 01:53:38,036
<i>But you would still miss me
in your bones</i>

1693
01:53:38,036 --> 01:53:40,940
<i>And I still talk to you</i>

1694
01:53:41,976 --> 01:53:45,505
<i>When I'm screaming
at the sky</i>

1695
01:53:45,505 --> 01:53:49,014
<i>And when you can't
sleep at night</i>

1696
01:53:49,014 --> 01:53:53,447
<i>You hear
my stolen lullabies</i>

1697
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:07,395
<i>I didn't have it in myself
to go with grace</i>

1698
01:54:07,395 --> 01:54:13,830
<i>And so the battleships
will sink beneath the waves</i>

1699
01:54:14,932 --> 01:54:16,866
<i>You had to kill me</i>

1700
01:54:16,866 --> 01:54:20,606
<i>But it killed you
just the same</i>

1701
01:54:20,606 --> 01:54:22,443
<i>Cursing my name</i>

1702
01:54:22,443 --> 01:54:24,115
<i>Wishing I stayed</i>

1703
01:54:24,115 --> 01:54:27,481
<i>You turned into
your worst fears</i>

1704
01:54:27,481 --> 01:54:31,716
<i>And you're tossing out blame
Drunk on this pain</i>

1705
01:54:31,716 --> 01:54:34,092
<i>Crossing out the good years</i>

1706
01:54:34,092 --> 01:54:36,996
<i>And you're cursing my name</i>

1707
01:54:36,996 --> 01:54:38,789
<i>Wishing I stayed</i>

1708
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:42,265
<i>Look at how
my tears ricochet</i>

1709
01:55:38,059 --> 01:55:40,983
<i>Midnight</i>

1710
01:55:40,983 --> 01:55:44,591
<i>You come and pick me up
No headlights</i>

1711
01:55:47,926 --> 01:55:49,761
<i>Long drive</i>

1712
01:55:50,995 --> 01:55:54,568
<i>Could end in burning flames
or paradise</i>

1713
01:55:57,606 --> 01:56:00,145
<i>Fade into view, oh</i>

1714
01:56:00,145 --> 01:56:04,413
<i>It's been a while since
I have even heard from you</i>

1715
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:07,416
<i>Heard from you</i>

1716
01:56:09,255 --> 01:56:11,816
<i>I should just tell you
to leave 'cause I</i>

1717
01:56:11,816 --> 01:56:13,917
<i>Know exactly
where it leads, but I</i>

1718
01:56:13,917 --> 01:56:17,360
<i>Watch us go 'round
and 'round each time</i>

1719
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:22,530
<i>You got that James Dean
daydream look in your eye</i>

1720
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:27,535
<i>And I got that red lip
classic thing that you like</i>

1721
01:56:27,535 --> 01:56:30,406
<i>And when we go crashing down</i>

1722
01:56:30,406 --> 01:56:32,375
<i>We come back every time</i>

1723
01:56:32,375 --> 01:56:35,246
<i>'Cause we never go
out of style</i>

1724
01:56:35,246 --> 01:56:37,842
<i>We never go out of style</i>

1725
01:56:37,842 --> 01:56:42,880
<i>You got that long hair
Slicked back, white T-shirt</i>

1726
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,685
<i>And I got that good girl faith</i>

1727
01:56:45,685 --> 01:56:48,050
<i>And a tight little skirt</i>

1728
01:56:48,050 --> 01:56:50,723
<i>And when we go crashing down</i>

1729
01:56:50,723 --> 01:56:52,923
<i>We come back every time</i>

1730

<i>We never go out of style</i>

1732
01:56:58,698 --> 01:57:01,470
<i>Take me home</i>

1733
01:57:03,144 --> 01:57:06,310
<i>Just take me home</i>

1734
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:08,312
<i>Yeah</i>

1735
01:57:08,312 --> 01:57:10,743
<i>Just take me home</i>

1736
01:57:10,743 --> 01:57:16,782
<i>Ooh, oh, ooh, oh, oh</i>

1737
01:57:16,782 --> 01:57:18,421
<i>Out of style
- Oh</i>

1738
01:57:18,421 --> 01:57:23,393
<i>You got that James Dean
daydream look in your eye</i>

01:57:33,403 --> 01:57:39,739
<i>We never go out of style</i>

1745
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:57,460
<i>Nice to meet you
Where you been?</i>

1746
01:57:57,460 --> 01:57:59,957
<i>I could show you
incredible things</i>

1747
01:57:59,957 --> 01:58:02,498
<i>Magic, madness, heaven, sin</i>

1748
01:58:02,498 --> 01:58:04,500
<i>Saw you there
and I thought</i>

1749
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,601
<i>"Oh, my God
Look at that face</i>

1750
01:58:06,601 --> 01:58:09,505
<i>"You look like
my next mistake</i>

1751
01:58:09,505 --> 01:58:13,509
<i>"Love's a game, wanna play?"</i>

1752
01:58:13,509 --> 01:58:14,708
<i>Ayy</i>

1753
01:58:14,708 --> 01:58:17,447
<i>New money, suit and tie</i>

1754
01:58:17,447 --> 01:58:19,977
<i>I can read you
like a magazine</i>

1755
01:58:19,977 --> 01:58:22,551
<i>Ain't it funny? Rumors fly</i>

1756
01:58:22,551 --> 01:58:24,850
<i>And I know you heard
about me</i>

1757
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:26,852
<i>So, hey, let's be friends</i>

1758
01:58:26,852 --> 01:58:29,459
<i>I'm dying to see
how this one ends</i>

1759
01:58:29,459 --> 01:58:32,055
<i>Grab your passport
and my hand</i>

1760
01:58:32,055 --> 01:58:34,662
<i>I can make the bad guys good
for a weekend</i>

1761
01:58:34,662 --> 01:58:37,203
<i>So it's gonna be forever</i>

1762
01:58:37,203 --> 01:58:39,634
<i>Or it's gonna
go down in flames</i>

1763
01:58:39,634 --> 01:58:42,164
<i>You can tell me
when it's over, mm</i>

1764
01:58:42,164 --> 01:58:44,672
<i>If the high
was worth the pain</i>

1765

<i>Got a long list of ex-lovers</i>

1766
01:58:47,411 --> 01:58:49,677
<i>They'll tell you I'm insane</i>

1767
01:58:49,677 --> 01:58:52,251
<i>'Cause you know
I love the players</i>

1768
01:58:52,251 --> 01:58:54,682
<i>And you love the game</i>

1769
01:58:54,682 --> 01:58:57,421
<i>'Cause we're young
and we're reckless</i>

1770
01:58:57,421 --> 01:58:59,720
<i>We'll take this
way too far</i>

1771
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:02,327
<i>It'll leave you
breathless, mm</i>

1772
01:59:02,327 --> 01:59:04,692
<i>Or with a nasty scar</i>

1773
01:59:04,692 --> 01:59:07,332
<i>Got a long list of ex-lovers</i>

1774

<i>They'll tell you I'm insane</i>

1775
01:59:09,763 --> 01:59:12,700
<i>But I've got
a blank space, baby</i>

1776
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:15,241
<i>- And I'll write your name</i>

1777
01:59:19,907 --> 01:59:22,611
<i>Cherry lips, crystal skies</i>

1778
01:59:22,611 --> 01:59:25,075
<i>I could show you
incredible things</i>

1779
01:59:25,075 --> 01:59:27,616
<i>Stolen kisses, pretty lies</i>

1780
01:59:27,616 --> 01:59:29,717
<i>You're the King, baby
I'm your Queen</i>

1781
01:59:29,717 --> 01:59:32,016
<i>Find out what you want</i>

1782
01:59:32,016 --> 01:59:34,293
<i>Be that girl for a month</i>

1783

<i>Wait, the worst
is yet to come</i>

1784
01:59:38,396 --> 01:59:39,958
<i>Oh, no</i>

1785
01:59:39,958 --> 01:59:42,565
<i>Screaming, crying
Perfect storms</i>

1786
01:59:42,565 --> 01:59:45,227
<i>I can make
all the tables turn</i>

1787
01:59:45,227 --> 01:59:47,702
<i>Rose garden
filled with thorns</i>

1788
01:59:47,702 --> 01:59:49,638
<i>Keep you
second-guessing like</i>

1789
01:59:49,638 --> 01:59:51,640
<i>"Oh, my God, who is she?"</i>

1790
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:54,379
<i>I get drunk on jealousy</i>

1791
01:59:54,379 --> 01:59:56,876
<i>But you'll come back
each time you leave</i>

1792
01:59:56,876 --> 01:59:58,317
<i>'Cause, darling
I'm a nightmare</i>

1793
01:59:58,317 --> 01:59:59,912
<i>Dressed like a daydream</i>

1794
01:59:59,912 --> 02:00:02,288

02:08:43,336 --> 02:08:45,767
<i>go back through</i>

1975
02:08:45,767 --> 02:08:48,308
<i>all these different phases
I've had musically,</i>

1976
02:08:48,308 --> 02:08:49,848
<i>because it's been,</i>

1977
02:08:49,848 --> 02:08:51,575
<i>I mean, it's been
a little bit of everything.</i>

1978
02:08:51,575 --> 02:08:55,579
<i>You've been so kind to me
in letting me explore genres</i>

1979
02:08:55,579 --> 02:08:58,120
<i>and step outside boxes
that are created for us</i>

1980
02:08:58,120 --> 02:08:59,583
<i>in the music industry.</i>

1981
02:08:59,583 --> 02:09:02,256
<i>And that's only because of you
that I get to do that.</i>

1982
02:09:02,256 --> 02:09:03,752
<i>So, thank you...</i>

1983
02:09:07,032 --> 02:09:08,328
<i>...because it's just
so much fun.</i>

1984
02:09:08,328 --> 02:09:09,626
<i>It's just so much fun
to get to play,</i>

1985
02:09:09,626 --> 02:09:10,869
<i>and to get to experiment,</i>

1986
02:09:10,869 --> 02:09:12,167
<i>and to get to grow
as an artist.</i>

1987
02:09:12,167 --> 02:09:13,465
<i>But I did want to play a song</i>

1988
02:09:14,633 --> 02:09:18,943
<i>just to thank the people
who liked me</i>

1989
02:09:18,943 --> 02:09:22,111
<i>when I was a little teenager
writing songs</i>

1990
02:09:22,111 --> 02:09:24,179
<i>for my ninth grade
talent show.</i>

1991
02:09:44,696 --> 02:09:47,466
<i>I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone</i>

1992
02:09:47,466 --> 02:09:49,875
<i>In the front seat of his car</i>

1993
02:09:49,875 --> 02:09:51,338
<i>He's got a one-hand feel</i>

1994
02:09:51,338 --> 02:09:52,702
<i>On the steering wheel</i>

1995
02:09:52,702 --> 02:09:55,639
<i>The other on my heart</i>

1996
02:09:55,639 --> 02:09:57,883
<i>I look around
Turn the radio down</i>

1997
02:09:57,883 --> 02:10:00,479
<i>He says
"Baby, is something wrong?"</i>

1998
02:10:00,479 --> 02:10:02,921
<i>I say, "Nothing
I was just thinking</i>

1999
02:10:02,921 --> 02:10:05,022
<i>"How we don't have a song"</i>

2000
02:10:06,454 --> 02:10:07,750
<i>And he says</i>

2001
02:10:07,750 --> 02:10:09,928
<i>Our song is
the slamming screen door</i>

2002
02:10:09,928 --> 02:10:13,096
<i>Sneakin' out late
Tapping on your window</i>

2003
02:10:13,096 --> 02:10:16,198
<i>When we're on the phone
and you talk real slow</i>

2004
02:10:16,198 --> 02:10:18,497
<i>'Cause it's late
and your mama don't know</i>

2005
02:10:18,497 --> 02:10:20,103
<i>Our song
is the way you laugh</i>

2006
02:10:20,103 --> 02:10:21,533
<i>The first date</i>

2007
02:10:21,533 --> 02:10:23,733
<i>"Man, I didn't kiss her
and I should have"</i>

2008
02:10:23,733 --> 02:10:28,947
<i>And when I got home
'fore I said, "Amen"</i>

2009
02:10:28,947 --> 02:10:33,985
<i>Asking God
if he could play it again</i>

2010
02:10:44,558 --> 02:10:46,558
<i>I was walking up
The front porch steps</i>

2011
02:10:46,558 --> 02:10:49,297
<i>After everything that day</i>

2012
02:10:49,297 --> 02:10:50,793
<i>Had gone all wrong</i>

2013
02:10:50,793 --> 02:10:54,698
<i>And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away</i>

2014
02:10:54,698 --> 02:10:57,371
<i>Got to the hallway
Well, on my way</i>

2015
02:10:57,371 --> 02:10:59,868
<i>To my lovin' bed</i>

2016
02:10:59,868 --> 02:11:01,375
<i>I almost didn't notice</i>

2017
02:11:01,375 --> 02:11:05,313
<i>All the roses
And the note that said</i>

2018
02:11:05,313 --> 02:11:07,810
<i>Our song is
the slamming screen door</i>

2019
02:11:07,810 --> 02:11:10,879
<i>Sneakin' out late
Tapping on your window</i>

2027
02:11:42,979 --> 02:11:48,257
<i>I've heard every album
Listened to the radio</i>

2028
02:11:48,257 --> 02:11:53,262
<i>Waited for something
to come along</i>

2029
02:11:53,262 --> 02:11:57,035
<i>That was as good as our song</i>

2030
02:11:57,035 --> 02:11:59,466
<i>'Cause our song is
the slamming screen door</i>

02:12:27,331 --> 02:12:32,565
<i>Play it again</i>

2040
02:12:32,565 --> 02:12:35,370
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

2041
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:37,075
<i>Oh-oh, yeah</i>

2042
02:12:38,507 --> 02:12:41,211

<i>In the front seat of his car</i>

2044
02:12:44,282 --> 02:12:45,743
<i>I grabbed a pen</i>

2045
02:12:45,743 --> 02:12:50,880
<i>And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song</i>

2046
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:31,195
<i>Summer went away
Still the yearning stays</i>

2047
02:13:31,195 --> 02:13:34,957
<i>I play it cool
with the best of them</i>

2048
02:13:34,957 --> 02:13:36,893
<i>I wait patiently</i>

2049
02:13:36,893 --> 02:13:39,434
<i>He's gonna notice me</i>

2050
02:13:39,434 --> 02:13:43,174
<i>It's okay
We're the best of friends</i>

2051
02:13:44,573 --> 02:13:46,738
<i>Anyway</i>

2052
02:13:46,738 --> 02:13:48,740
<i>I hear it in your voice</i>

2053
02:13:48,740 --> 02:13:50,775
<i>You're smoking
with your boys</i>

2054
02:13:50,775 --> 02:13:54,911
<i>I touch my phone
as if it's your face</i>

2055
02:13:54,911 --> 02:13:56,748
<i>I didn't choose this town</i>

2056
02:13:56,748 --> 02:13:59,157
<i>I dream of getting out</i>

2057
02:13:59,157 --> 02:14:02,820
<i>There's just one
who could make me stay</i>

2058
02:14:04,296 --> 02:14:06,956
<i>All my days</i>

2059
02:14:06,956 --> 02:14:11,059
<i>From sprinkler splashes
to fireplace ashes</i>

2060
02:14:11,059 --> 02:14:14,964
<i>I waited ages
to see you there</i>

2061
02:14:14,964 --> 02:14:19,144
<i>I search the party
of better bodies</i>

2062
02:14:19,144 --> 02:14:23,775
<i>Just to learn
that you never cared</i>

2063
02:14:23,775 --> 02:14:26,679
<i>You're on your own, kid
You always have been</i>

2064
02:14:34,656 --> 02:14:36,590
<i>I see the great escape</i>

2065
02:14:36,590 --> 02:14:38,493
<i>So long, Daisy May</i>

2066
02:14:38,493 --> 02:14:42,497
<i>I picked the petals
He loves me not</i>

2067
02:14:42,497 --> 02:14:44,598
<i>Something different bloomed</i>

2068
02:14:44,598 --> 02:14:46,501
<i>Writing in my room</i>

2069
02:14:46,501 --> 02:14:50,538
<i>I play my songs
in the parking lot</i>

2070
02:14:51,739 --> 02:14:54,509
<i>I'll run away</i>

2071
02:14:54,509 --> 02:14:58,546
<i>From sprinkler splashes
to fireplace ashes</i>

2072
02:14:58,546 --> 02:15:02,385
<i>I called a taxi
to take me there</i>

2073
02:15:02,385 --> 02:15:06,620
<i>I search the party
of better bodies</i>

2074
02:15:06,620 --> 02:15:11,229
<i>Just to learn
that my dreams aren't rare</i>

2075
02:15:11,229 --> 02:15:14,496
<i>You're on your own, kid
You always have been</i>

2076
02:15:30,250 --> 02:15:34,219
<i>From sprinkler splashes
to fireplace ashes</i>

2077
02:15:34,219 --> 02:15:38,080
<i>I gave my blood, sweat
and tears for this</i>

2078
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:42,084
<i>I hosted parties
and starved my body</i>

2079
02:15:42,084 --> 02:15:46,022
<i>Like I'd be saved
by a perfect kiss</i>

2080
02:15:46,022 --> 02:15:50,026
<i>The jokes weren't funny
I took the money</i>

2081
02:15:50,026 --> 02:15:53,865
<i>My friends from home
don't know what to say</i>

2082
02:15:53,865 --> 02:15:57,572
<i>I looked around
in a blood-soaked gown</i>

2083
02:15:57,572 --> 02:16:01,576
<i>And I saw something
they can't take away</i>

2084
02:16:01,576 --> 02:16:03,611
<i>'Cause there were pages turned</i>

2085
02:16:03,611 --> 02:16:05,613
<i>With the bridges burned</i>

2086
02:16:05,613 --> 02:16:09,551
<i>Everything you lose
is a step you take</i>

2087
02:16:09,551 --> 02:16:11,784
<i>So make
the friendship bracelets</i>

2088
02:16:11,784 --> 02:16:13,852
<i>Take the moment and taste it</i>

2089
02:16:13,852 --> 02:16:17,823
<i>You've got no reason
to be afraid</i>

2090
02:16:18,661 --> 02:16:20,595
<i>You're on your own, kid</i>

2091
02:16:22,896 --> 02:16:24,764
<i>Yeah, you can face this</i>

2092
02:16:27,164 --> 02:16:30,242
<i>You're on your own, kid
You always have been</i>

2093
02:18:22,915 --> 02:18:24,686
<i>Meet me at midnight</i>

2094
02:18:28,461 --> 02:18:30,857
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

2095
02:18:30,857 --> 02:18:33,321
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

2096
02:18:33,321 --> 02:18:35,928
<i>Oh oh-oh whoa</i>

2097
02:18:35,928 --> 02:18:38,898
<i>Whoa whoa whoa whoa</i>

2098
02:18:38,898 --> 02:18:40,735
<i>Staring at the ceiling
with you</i>

2099
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:46,741
<i>Oh, you don't ever
say too much</i>

2100
02:18:48,778 --> 02:18:51,108
<i>You don't really read into</i>

2101
02:18:52,045 --> 02:18:56,454
<i>My melancholia</i>

2102
02:18:59,492 --> 02:19:01,888
<i>- I've been under scrutiny</i>
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2103
02:19:01,888 --> 02:19:04,429
<i>- You handle it beautifully</i>
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2104
02:19:04,429 --> 02:19:05,958
<i>All this shit is new to me</i>

2105
02:19:05,958 --> 02:19:07,223
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2106
02:19:09,392 --> 02:19:13,768
<i>I feel the lavender haze
creeping up on me</i>

2107
02:19:14,166 --> 02:19:15,704
<i>Surreal</i>

2108
02:19:15,704 --> 02:19:18,905
<i>I'm damned if I do give
a damn what people say</i>

2109
02:19:18,905 --> 02:19:20,544
<i>No deal</i>

2110
02:19:20,544 --> 02:19:24,878
<i>The 1950s shit
they want from me</i>

2111
02:19:24,878 --> 02:19:30,147
<i>I just wanna stay
in that lavender haze</i>

2112
02:19:30,147 --> 02:19:32,886
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

2113
02:19:32,886 --> 02:19:35,284
<i>Oh oh-oh whoa</i>

2114
02:19:35,284 --> 02:19:37,627
<i>Whoa whoa whoa whoa</i>

2115
02:19:38,454 --> 02:19:40,289
<i>All they keep asking me</i>

2116
02:19:40,289 --> 02:19:41,565
<i>All they keep asking me</i>

2117
02:19:41,565 --> 02:19:46,097
<i>Is if I'm gonna be your bride</i>

2118
02:19:48,299 --> 02:19:50,167
<i>The only kinda girl they see</i>

2119
02:19:50,167 --> 02:19:51,476
<i>Only kinda girl they see</i>

2120
02:19:51,476 --> 02:19:56,008
<i>Is a one-night or a wife</i>

2121
02:19:58,881 --> 02:20:01,277
<i>- I find it dizzying</i>
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2122
02:20:01,277 --> 02:20:02,619
<i>They're bringing up
my history</i>

2123
02:20:02,619 --> 02:20:03,785
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2124
02:20:03,785 --> 02:20:05,116
<i>But you weren't
even listening</i>

2125
02:20:05,116 --> 02:20:06,623
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

2126
02:20:07,219 --> 02:20:08,757
<i>Ooh ooh ooh</i>

2127
02:20:08,757 --> 02:20:13,597
<i>I feel the lavender haze
creeping up on me</i>

2128
02:20:13,597 --> 02:20:15,423
<i>Surreal</i>

2129
02:20:15,423 --> 02:20:18,635
<i>I'm damned if I do give
a damn what people say</i>

2130
02:20:18,635 --> 02:20:20,296
<i>No deal</i>

2131
02:20:20,296 --> 02:20:24,168

2132
02:20:24,168 --> 02:20:29,778
<i>I just wanna stay

where I get older</i>

2159
02:21:50,353 --> 02:21:52,355
<i>But just never wiser</i>

2160
02:21:52,355 --> 02:21:55,424
<i>Midnights become
my afternoons</i>

2161
02:21:57,395 --> 02:22:00,528
<i>When my depression
works the graveyard shift</i>

2162
02:22:00,528 --> 02:22:02,530
<i>All of the people</i>

2163

<i>I should not be left

2165
02:22:10,208 --> 02:22:12,650
<i>They come with prices

2166
02:22:12,650 --> 02:22:14,542
<i>I end up in crisis</i>

2167
02:22:14,542 --> 02:22:17,314

<i>For the last time</i>

2172
02:22:26,488 --> 02:22:31,493

<i>But never in the mirror</i>

2176
02:22:41,437 --> 02:22:46,882
<i>It must be exhausting always
rooting for the anti-hero</i>

2177
02:22:51,856 --> 02:22:57,123
<i>Sometimes, I feel like
everybody is a sexy baby</i>

2178
02:22:57,123 --> 02:22:59,697
<i>And I'm a monster on the hill</i>

2179
02:23:01,866 --> 02:23:03,261
<i>Too big to hang out</i>

2180
02:23:03,261 --> 02:23:06,770
<i>Slowly lurching toward
your favorite city</i>

2181
02:23:06,770 --> 02:23:09,531
<i>Pierced through the heart
but never killed</i>

2182
02:23:11,634 --> 02:23:14,844
<i>Did you hear
my covert narcissism</i>

2183
02:23:14,844 --> 02:23:17,110
<i>I disguise as altruism</i>

2184
02:23:17,110 --> 02:23:19,277
<i>Like some kind
of congressman?</i>

2185
02:23:19,277 --> 02:23:21,213
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

2186

<i>One day
I'll watch as you're leaving</i>

2188
02:23:26,647 --> 02:23:29,023
<i>And life will lose
all its meaning</i>

2189
02:23:29,023 --> 02:23:30,552
<i>For the last time</i>

2190
02:23:30,552 --> 02:23:33,027

2196
02:23:56,283 --> 02:23:57,722
<i>I have this dream</i>

2197
02:23:57,722 --> 02:24:01,154
<i>My daughter-in-law kills me
for the money</i>

2198
02:24:01,154 --> 02:24:04,124
<i>She thinks I left them
in the will</i>

2199
02:24:06,062 --> 02:24:08,898
<i>The family gathers 'round
and reads it</i>

2200
02:24:08,898 --> 02:24:11,065
<i>And then someone
screams out</i>

2201
02:24:11,065 --> 02:24:13,903
<i>"She's laughing up at us
from hell"</i>

2202
02:24:15,368 --> 02:24:18,270
<i>It's me, hi</i>

2203
02:24:18,270 --> 02:24:20,503
<i>I'm the problem, it's me</i>

2204

<i>It must be exhausting always

2216
02:25:08,322 --> 02:25:09,750
<i>Rain</i>

2217
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:12,654
<i>He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain</i>

2218
02:25:12,654 --> 02:25:15,965
<i>He wanted a bride
I was making my own name</i>

2219

<i>Chasing that fame</i>

2220

2221
02:25:19,496 --> 02:25:22,202
<i>All of me changed
Like midnight</i>

2222
02:25:36,317 --> 02:25:39,186
<i>My town
was a wasteland</i>

2223
02:25:39,186 --> 02:25:40,957
<i>Full of cages, full of fences</i>

2224
02:25:40,957 --> 02:25:43,993
<i>Pageant queens
and big pretenders</i>

2225
02:25:43,993 --> 02:25:47,491
<i>But for some it was paradise</i>

2226
02:25:50,067 --> 02:25:52,793
<i>My boy was a montage</i>

2227
02:25:52,793 --> 02:25:54,630
<i>A slow motion, love potion</i>

2228
02:25:54,630 --> 02:25:57,600
<i>Jumping off things
in the ocean</i>

2229
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:00,603
<i>I broke his heart
'cause he was nice</i>

2230
02:26:00,603 --> 02:26:02,979
<i>He was sunshine
I was midnight</i>

<i>Rain</i>

<i>All of me changed
Like midnight</i>

2237
02:26:17,389 --> 02:26:20,458
<i>It came like a postcard</i>

2238
02:26:20,458 --> 02:26:22,196
<i>Picture perfect shiny family</i>

2239
02:26:22,196 --> 02:26:25,166
<i>Holiday peppermint candy</i>

2240
02:26:25,166 --> 02:26:27,839
<i>But for him it's every day</i>

2241
02:26:30,734 --> 02:26:34,010
<i>So I peered through a window</i>

2242
02:26:34,010 --> 02:26:35,836
<i>A deep portal, time travel</i>

2243
02:26:35,836 --> 02:26:38,014
<i>All the love we unravel</i>

2244
02:26:38,775 --> 02:26:41,512
<i>And the life I gave away</i>

2245
02:26:41,512 --> 02:26:45,351
<i>'Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain</i>

2246
02:26:45,351 --> 02:26:48,717
<i>He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain</i>

02:26:55,559 --> 02:26:58,067
<i>All of me changed
Like midnight</i>

2251

2257
02:27:11,916 --> 02:27:14,611
<i>I guess sometimes we all get</i>

2258
02:27:14,611 --> 02:27:18,417
<i>Just what we wanted
Just what we wanted</i>

2259
02:27:18,417 --> 02:27:20,551
<i>And he never thinks of me</i>

2260
02:27:21,752 --> 02:27:23,785
<i>Except when I'm on TV</i>

2261
02:27:25,688 --> 02:27:28,361
<i>I guess sometimes we all get</i>

2262
02:27:28,361 --> 02:27:32,200
<i>Some kind of haunted
Some kind of haunted</i>

2263
02:27:32,200 --> 02:27:33,938
<i>And I never think of him</i>

2264
02:27:35,337 --> 02:27:37,865
<i>Except on midnights like this</i>

2265
02:27:37,865 --> 02:27:39,537
<i>Midnights like this</i>

2266
02:27:39,537 --> 02:27:41,913
<i>Midnights like this</i>

2267
02:27:56,389 --> 02:27:59,425
<i>Draw the cat eye
sharp enough to kill a man</i>

2268
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:06,597
<i>You did some bad things
but I'm the worst of them</i>

2269
02:28:08,106 --> 02:28:11,602
<i>Sometimes I wonder which one
will be your last lie</i>

2270
02:28:14,046 --> 02:28:18,378
<i>They say looks can kill
and I might try</i>

2271
02:28:19,315 --> 02:28:21,447
<i>I don't dress for women</i>

2272
02:28:22,450 --> 02:28:24,582
<i>I don't dress for men</i>

2273

<i>Lately I've been
dressing for revenge</i>

2274
02:28:29,257 --> 02:28:33,657
<i>I don't start shit, but
I can tell you how it ends</i>

2275
02:28:35,166 --> 02:28:39,168
<i>Don't get sad, get even</i>

2276
02:28:40,204 --> 02:28:43,172
<i>So on the weekends</i>

2277
02:28:43,172 --> 02:28:45,372
<i>I don't dress for friends</i>

2278
02:28:45,372 --> 02:28:48,408
<i>Lately I've been
dressing for revenge</i>

2279
02:28:50,005 --> 02:28:53,578
<i>She needed cold hard proof
so I gave her some</i>

2280
02:28:56,154 --> 02:28:57,516
<i>She had the envelope</i>

2281
02:28:57,516 --> 02:29:01,025
<i>Where you think
she got it from?</i>

2282
02:29:02,391 --> 02:29:03,555
<i>Now she gets the house</i>

2283
02:29:03,555 --> 02:29:05,755
<i>Gets the kids
Gets the pride</i>

2284
02:29:08,496 --> 02:29:13,070
<i>Picture me thick as thieves
with your ex-wife</i>

2285
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:15,402
<i>And she looks so pretty</i>

2286
02:29:16,339 --> 02:29:18,504
<i>Driving in your Benz</i>

2287
02:29:18,504 --> 02:29:21,441

2288
02:29:23,377 --> 02:29:24,642
<i>She don't start shit</i>

2289
02:29:24,642 --> 02:29:27,546
<i>But she can tell you
how it ends</i>

2290
02:29:29,044 --> 02:29:33,453
<i>Don't get sad, get even</i>

<i>Ladies always rise above</i>

2295
02:29:47,071 --> 02:29:50,206
<i>Ladies know
what people want</i>

2296
02:29:50,206 --> 02:29:53,242
<i>Someone sweet
and kind and fun</i>

2297
02:29:53,242 --> 02:29:58,247
<i>The lady simply had enough</i>

2298
02:29:58,247 --> 02:30:01,217
<i>While he was doing lines</i>

2299
02:30:01,217 --> 02:30:03,516
<i>And crossing all of mine</i>

2300
02:30:03,516 --> 02:30:06,915
<i>Someone told
his white collar crimes</i>

2301
02:30:06,915 --> 02:30:10,193
<i>To the FBI</i>

2302
02:30:10,193 --> 02:30:12,393
<i>And I don't
dress for villains</i>

2303
02:30:13,429 --> 02:30:15,396
<i>Or for innocents</i>

2304
02:30:15,396 --> 02:30:20,533
<i>I'm on my vigilante shit again</i>

2305
02:30:20,533 --> 02:30:24,306
<i>I don't start shit, but
I can tell you how it ends</i>

2306
02:30:26,178 --> 02:30:31,280
<i>Don't get sad, get even</i>

2307

2310
02:31:00,311 --> 02:31:04,280
<i>Baby love, I think I've been
a little too kind</i>

2311
02:31:06,449 --> 02:31:09,846
<i>Didn't notice you walking
all over my peace of mind</i>

2312
02:31:09,846 --> 02:31:11,749
<i>In the shoes
I gave you as a present</i>

2313
02:31:11,749 --> 02:31:13,916
<i>Putting someone first
only works</i>

2314

<i>When you're in their top five</i>

2315
02:31:17,119 --> 02:31:18,525
<i>And by the way</i>

2316
02:31:20,122 --> 02:31:21,858
<i>I'm going out tonight</i>

2317
02:31:23,532 --> 02:31:25,367
<i>Best believe
I'm still bejeweled</i>

2318

<i>When I walk in the room</i>

2319
02:31:26,863 --> 02:31:29,635
<i>I can still make
the whole place shimmer</i>

2320
02:31:29,635 --> 02:31:30,999
<i>And when I meet the band</i>

2321
02:31:30,999 --> 02:31:32,605
<i>They ask
"Do you have a man?"</i>

2322
02:31:32,605 --> 02:31:35,377
<i>I could still say
"I don't remember"</i>

2323
02:31:35,377 --> 02:31:38,677
<i>Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement</i>

<i>Diamonds in my eyes</i>

2326
02:31:44,144 --> 02:31:48,192

I polish up real nice</i>

2327
02:31:52,330 --> 02:31:53,329
<i>Nice</i>

2328
02:31:58,897 --> 02:32:02,668
<i>Baby boy, I think I've been
too good of a girl</i>

2329
02:32:02,668 --> 02:32:04,901
<i>Too good of a girl</i>

2330
02:32:04,901 --> 02:32:08,575
<i>Did all the extra credit
Then got graded on a curve</i>

2331
02:32:08,575 --> 02:32:10,346
<i>I think it's time
to teach some lessons</i>

2332
02:32:10,346 --> 02:32:12,480
<i>I made you my world
Have you heard?</i>

2333
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:14,713
<i>I can reclaim the land</i>

2334
02:32:16,046 --> 02:32:17,749
<i>And I miss you</i>

2335
02:32:18,554 --> 02:32:21,082
<i>But I miss sparkling</i>

2336
02:32:21,082 --> 02:32:22,358
<i>Nice</i>

2337
02:32:22,358 --> 02:32:23,986

<i>I knew I wanted your body</i>

2405
02:35:58,739 --> 02:36:02,743

<i>No one wanted to play
with me as a little kid</i>

2412
02:36:25,964 --> 02:36:29,770
<i>So I've been scheming
like a criminal ever since</i>

2413
02:36:29,770 --> 02:36:33,642
<i>To make them love me
and make it seem effortless</i>

2414
02:36:33,642 --> 02:36:36,942
<i>This is the first time I've
felt the need to confess</i>

2415
02:36:36,942 --> 02:36:40,308
<i>And I swear</i>

2416
02:36:40,308 --> 02:36:43,245
<i>I'm only cryptic
and Machiavellian</i>

2417
02:36:43,245 --> 02:36:45,445
<i>'Cause I care</i>

2418
02:36:45,445 --> 02:36:48,283
<i>So I told you none of it
was accidental</i>

2419
02:36:48,283 --> 02:36:50,120
<i>And the first night
that you saw me</i>

<i>Nothing was gonna stop me</i>

2421
02:36:52,254 --> 02:36:56,093
<i>I laid the groundwork
and then saw a wide smirk</i>

2422
02:36:56,093 --> 02:36:59,030
<i>On your face
You knew the entire time</i>

2423
02:36:59,030 --> 02:37:02,033
<i>You knew
that I'm a mastermind</i>

<i>And now you're mine</i>

2425
02:37:06,743 --> 02:37:09,238
<i>Yeah, all you did
was smile</i>

2426

02:49:12,664 --> 02:49:15,667
<i>Follow you around</i>

2581
02:49:15,667 --> 02:49:19,506
<i>You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night</i>

2582
02:49:19,506 --> 02:49:22,608
<i>Burning it down</i>

2583
02:49:22,608 --> 02:49:26,414
<i>Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories</i>

2584
02:49:26,414 --> 02:49:32,948
<i>Follow you around</i>

2585
02:50:14,288 --> 02:50:17,333
<i>I said
Remember this moment</i>

2586
02:50:19,194 --> 02:50:22,437
<i>In the back of my mind</i>

2587
02:50:23,803 --> 02:50:27,607
<i>The time we stood
with our shaking hands</i>

2588
02:50:27,607 --> 02:50:31,479
<i>The crowds in stands went wild</i>

2589
02:50:33,239 --> 02:50:36,682
<i>We were
the kings and the queens</i>

2590
02:50:38,180 --> 02:50:42,457
<i>And they read off our names</i>

2591
02:50:42,457 --> 02:50:46,285
<i>The night you danced like
you knew our lives</i>

2592
02:50:46,285 --> 02:50:50,223
<i>Would never be the same</i>

2593
02:50:51,996 --> 02:50:55,129
<i>You held your head
like a hero</i>

2594
02:50:56,902 --> 02:51:00,200
<i>On a history book page</i>

2595
02:51:01,335 --> 02:51:04,677
<i>It was the end of a decade</i>

2596
02:51:06,241 --> 02:51:09,517
<i>But the start of an age</i>

2597
02:51:12,214 --> 02:51:15,853
<i>Long live
the walls we crashed through</i>

2598
02:51:15,853 --> 02:51:20,154
<i>How the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you</i>

2599
02:51:20,154 --> 02:51:24,829
<i>I was screaming
Long live
all the magic we made</i>

2600
02:51:24,829 --> 02:51:28,371
<i>And bring on
all the pretenders</i>

2601
02:51:28,371 --> 02:51:32,870
<i>One day
we will be remembered</i>

2602
02:51:34,203 --> 02:51:37,347
<i>I said
Remember this feeling</i>

2603
02:51:38,878 --> 02:51:42,275
<i>I pass the pictures around</i>

2604
02:51:43,883 --> 02:51:46,752
<i>Of all the years
that we stood there</i>

2605
02:51:46,752 --> 02:51:52,120
<i>On the sidelines
wishing for right now</i>

2606
02:51:53,255 --> 02:51:56,663
<i>We are
the kings and the queens</i>

2607
02:51:56,663 --> 02:52:01,129
<i>You traded your baseball cap
for a crown</i>

2608
02:52:03,034 --> 02:52:06,233
<i>When they gave us
our trophies</i>

2609
02:52:06,233 --> 02:52:11,106
<i>And we held them up
for our town</i>

2610
02:52:12,307 --> 02:52:15,946
<i>And the cynics were outraged</i>

2611
02:52:17,114 --> 02:52:21,281
<i>Screaming, this is absurd</i>

2612
02:52:21,281 --> 02:52:27,463
<i>'Cause for a moment
a band of thieves
in ripped-up jeans</i>

2613
02:52:27,463 --> 02:52:32,468
<i>Got to rule the world</i>

2614
02:52:32,468 --> 02:52:36,032
<i>Long live the walls
we crashed through</i>

2615
02:52:36,032 --> 02:52:40,135
<i>How the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you</i>

<i>I was screaming

all the pretenders
I'm not afraid</i>

2618
02:52:51,113 --> 02:52:54,380
<i>Long live
all the mountains we moved</i>

2619
02:52:54,380 --> 02:52:59,462
<i>I had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you</i>

2620
02:52:59,462 --> 02:53:03,763
<i>I was screaming
Long live
that look on your face</i>

2621
02:53:03,763 --> 02:53:07,327
<i>And bring on
all the pretenders</i>

2622
02:53:07,327 --> 02:53:11,705
<i>One day
we will be remembered</i>

2623
02:53:15,612 --> 02:53:18,976
<i>Hold on
to spinning around</i>

2624
02:53:18,976 --> 02:53:23,783
<i>Confetti falls
to the ground</i>

2625
02:53:23,783 --> 02:53:30,625
<i>May these memories
break our fall</i>

2626
02:53:32,662 --> 02:53:35,289
<i>Will you take a moment</i>

2627
02:53:37,832 --> 02:53:39,568
<i>Promise me this</i>

2628
02:53:41,671 --> 02:53:45,299
<i>That you'll
stand by me forever</i>

2629
02:53:45,299 --> 02:53:48,841
<i>But if, God forbid
Fate should step in</i>

2630
02:53:51,142 --> 02:53:54,682
<i>- And force us into a goodbye</i>

2631
02:53:55,718 --> 02:53:58,719
<i>If you have children someday</i>

2632
02:54:00,822 --> 02:54:03,856
<i>When they point
to the pictures</i>

2633
02:54:05,387 --> 02:54:07,563
<i>Please tell them my name</i>

2634
02:54:10,425 --> 02:54:15,296
<i>Tell them how
the crowds went wild</i>

2635
02:54:15,296 --> 02:54:19,542
<i>Tell them how
I hope they shine</i>

2636
02:54:20,842 --> 02:54:24,074
<i>Long live
the walls we crashed through</i>

2637
02:54:24,074 --> 02:54:27,176

the walls we crashed through</i>
